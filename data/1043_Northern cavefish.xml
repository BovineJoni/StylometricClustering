The runner wider measures two hundred feet long, the most impressive cave hundred high and the well depths, a hundred and fifty.
The Eco River, three-quarters of a mile long and two hundred feet at most, wide, slides under a dome of fifteen high.
owes its name to the endless echoes repeats.
Its waters are fish without eyes."
So says the "Guide to America", describing the famous Mammoth Cave, located in the National Park of the same name in Kentucky.

The fish referred to are the most typical ambliopsidos spelaeus species, known to science since 1842.
In just over ten inches long, have very slender body, long head, no eyes and scales, and equipped, as all the tops and sides of the trunk, numerous transverse linear reliefs, in which sensory endings abound.
The dorsal fin, well behind, is very high, short, and is at the same level as the anal, which is the same dimensions.
The tail is rounded little fan later, the pectoral fins have medium development, and abdominal, located in the middle of the body, are very small.
Depigmented, translucent and blind, these small amblyopsis live exclusively in the groundwater of Kentucky and southern Indiana.
Abundant in the famous Mammoth Cave, being a distraction for visitors.
Calmly swim near the surface "as white aquatic ghosts" in the words of Professor Cope, who studied in the late nineteenth century, ready to disappear into the depths to sound.
These fish, barely sensitive to light, they perceive the slightest vibrations in the air and take refuge in the murky river's depth.
They eat many animals, almost all blind or low vision, with white color of the cave fauna who live in the same medium.
Despite its apparent fragility, amblyopsis enjoy a tenacious vitality and can be kept in aquariums.
J.R.R.
Tolkien, in his book "The Hobbit" describes fish like these inhabitants of an underground lake.

The blind cavefish is blind and depigmented.
Despite the lack of eyes it does respond to light and moves away from it, scotophilia.
Cavefishes are generally small, ranging up to 11 cm in length.
Most do not have pelvic fins, although Amblyopsis spelaea has small ones with up to six rays.
They are predator just only resulting from the lack of vegetation, inhabiting subterranean water or caves which have consolidated mud-rock substrates in shoals and silt-sand substrates in pools but is more often found in caves with uniform silt-sand substrates.
Has low reproduction rate and broods eggs in gill cavity for up to 4-5 months.
Can live for 2 years without food because of low metabolic rate.</entry>
