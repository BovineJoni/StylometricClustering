No one knows for sure exactly what happened but it is believed that Malia and Natasha masterminded a series of pranks (practical jokes) that left the President losing sense of self.
One of which was changing the calendar so when Barack woke up it still said is was March 31st.
That kept Barack off guard through out the early morning.
The secret service found Barack barking at Bo.
When asked why Barack stated “he had it coming, and I meant ever word.” Barack then tried to run away from the secret service men who grabbed the President and dragged him back into the white house.
Barack was accused of resisting and yelling “Who are you!
And why are you taking me.” Barack later said he was just trying to be funny and that it was all of joke.
But by then massive attempts had been made to isolate and cover up the incident.
So most people had no idea what he was talking about.
Causing many media outlets to go in a frenzy speculating on what Barack meant and how this changes his Presidency.
Barack seems to be fixated on the pranks pull on him even through the cover up which lasted most of this morning.
Most credit the discovery of the cover up to Barack Obama who was heard saying.
“I know what I will do, I’ll change it to tomorrow so I can have my revenge!” then ran across the White House front lawn laughing hysterically.
