Scores above 0 are "ranked", with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on.
The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered "superior" in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small.

A character's ability scores are purchased during character generation in an auction; players get 100 character points, and bid on each attribute in turn.
Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is "superior" to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference.
After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank.
Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.
Characters with high psyche are presented as having strong telepathic abilities, being able to hypnotise and even mind-rape any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact.
This is likely due to two scenes in the Chronicles: first, when Corwin faces the demon Strygwalldir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and second, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos.
However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic is involved in both the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power when it would have almost certainly assured Brand of victory.
Characters in Amber DRPG have access to the powers seen in the Chronicles of Amber: Pattern, Logrus, Shape-shifting, Trump Artistry, and magic.
A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe, and while there can manipulate probability.
A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themself or objects through shadow.
Shape-shifters can alter their physical form, and Trump Artists can create Trumps, a sort of tarot card which allows mental communication and travel.
Three types of magic are detailed: Power Words, with a quick, small effect; Sorcery, with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems; and Conjuration, the creation of small objects.
Each of the first three powers is available in an advanced form.
While a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues - unbreakability, or a mind of their own.
Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character, and cannot lightly be destroyed.
Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) "real" and therefore useful.
The expansion, Shadow knight, adds Constructs - artifacts with connections to shadows.
Unspent character points become good stuff - a good luck for the character.
Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming bad stuff - bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character.
As well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character's outlook on the universe: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.
In any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win.
The key word here is fair - if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can prevail - and eventually.
This concept has been developed further in John Wick's Advantage system.
Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict.
For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance.
This concept is similar to the concept of escalation in Dogs in the Vineyard.
If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.
Amber DRPG advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit - even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes.</entry>
