This can be dated back to Hipparchus, who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors Timocharis and Aristillos to discover the earth’s precession.
In doing so, he also invented the brightness scale still in use today.

James Bradley first tried to measure parallax in 1729.
The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his telescope, but he instead discovered the aberration of light and the nutation of the earth’s axis.
His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by Friedrich Willhelm Bessel, the father of modern astrometry.
He made the first measurement of stellar parallax:.3 arcsec for the binary star 61 Cygni.

Being very difficult to accomplish, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been measured by the end of the 19th century.
Automated plate measuring machines and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960’s allowed for larger compilations of star catalogues to be achieved more efficiently.
In the 1980’s, charged- couple devices (CCD’s) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond (mas).
The advent in this technology made astrometry less expensive, opening the field to an amateur audience.

On August 8, 1989, Hipparcos (High Precision PARallax COllecting Satellite) took astrometry into orbit, where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the earth and its atmosphere.
Operated by the European Space Agency from 1989 to 1993, Hipparcos was meant to measure large and small angles on the sky with greater precision than optical telescopes.
During it’s 4-year run, the positions, parallaxes, and proper motions of 118,218 stars were determined with an incredible degree of accuracy.
A new catalogue “Tycho” drew together a database of 1,058,332 to within 20-30 mas.
Additional catalogues were compiled for the 23,882 double/multiple stars and 11,597 variable stars also analyzed during the Hipparcos mission.</entry>
