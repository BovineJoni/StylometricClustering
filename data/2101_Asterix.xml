  <entry author_id="873669" end="11" start="0">Asterix is a small but fearless and cunning warrior, ever eager for any new adventure.
He is a confirmed bachelor, and one of the smartest (and sanest) members of his village (sometimes referred to as a 'village of madmen').
Because of this he is usually chosen for any dangerous, important or exotic mission.
Unlike most of the other villagers he does not start or join brawls for the fun of it, although he does enjoy a good fight when there's cause.
He rarely resorts to weapons, preferring to rely on his wits, and when necessary his (magic potion enhanced) fists -- he is only an average swordsman.

All Asterix stories by Goscinny and Uderzo which have been officially translated into English have been done by Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge.
However there have been some additional translations done in an attept to enter the American market.
From November 1977 until early 1979 five albums were serialized in syndicated form in a number of North American newspapers.
Since these were printed as part of the standard daily comics, and were broken into separately licenced, concurrent daily and Sunday strips, the art needed considerable reworking which required re-editing of much of the dialog.
In addition, a number of names, jokes and pieces of art were further changed to be more politically correct and idiomatic for the newspapers' family-oriented comics audience.
The results were less than engaging and the stories printed appeared in essentially random order causing a mercifully swift demise to the experiment.</entry>
  <entry author_id="6338567" end="83" start="11">This is a list of all Asterix volumes, including the 33 official albums and various tie-ins.
1961 – Asterix the Gaul (Astérix le Gaulois), The first album where the main characters are introduced.
The style of Uderzo's drawing changes a lot until it stabilizes towards the end into the style he would keep and develop for the rest of the series.
The Romans discover that the secret of the Gauls' strength is the magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix, so they decide to capture the druid and get the recipe out of him.
It is up to Asterix and his wits to save Getafix.

1964 – Asterix the Gladiator (Astérix gladiateur) Rome  Odius Asparagus, the prefect of Gaul, captures Cacofonix and sends him as a present to Caesar.
Unimpressed by Cacofonix, Caesar orders him to be thrown to the Lions at the Circus Maximus.
Asterix and Obelix hitchhike all the way to Rome where they must become gladiators to rescue him.

1965 – Asterix and the Banquet (Le Tour de Gaule d'Astérix) Various French cities  Unsuccessful at conquering the village, the Romans decide to isolate it by building a stockade.
In order to remove it, Asterix strikes a bet with the Romans that he and Obelix can travel throughout Gaul and back to the village with various Gaulish delicacies without the Romans being able to stop them.
The route is a parallel to the modern Tour de France cycling event.
It's in this adventure that Obelix gets his dog, Dogmatix.

1965 – Asterix and Cleopatra (Astérix et Cléopâtre) Egypt  Caesar calls the Egyptians inferior to the Romans.
Outraged, Cleopatra wagers with him that her people can build a grand monument in record time.
Edifis, a bumbling, timid architect is asked to perform the miracle, and asks his old friend Getafix for help.
Meanwhile, his rival and Caesar's agents attempt to sabotage the effort.

1966 – Asterix and the Big Fight (Le combat des chefs) no travels  The Romans conspire with a Roman-friendly Gaulish village to declare a ritual winner-takes-all fight between the village chiefs.
One of Obelix's menhirs causes Getafix to lose his memory, leaving the Gauls without magic potion.
The fight parodies professional boxing.

1969 – Asterix in Spain (Astérix en Hispanie) Spain, first appearance of Unhygienix  Pepe, a young and spoiled child, is taken from the Romans.
He turns out to be Spanish, and held hostage in an attempt to get them to surrender.
Asterix and Obelix escort the child back to Spain.

1973 – Asterix in Corsica (Astérix en Corse) Corsica  As part of the celebrations of the anniversary of Vercingetorix's victory at the Battle of Gergovia, the Gauls and their friends raid one of the nearby Roman camps.
A very stoic and composed prisoner is discovered, who reveals himself as Boneywasawarriorwayayix, a tribal leader from Corsica.
Asterix and Obelix accompany him back to Corsica, to unite the quarrelling tribes against the Romans.

1974 – Asterix and Caesar's Gift (Le Cadeau de César) Rome  At the end of their career, legionaries are granted estate in the Empire to settle down.
A perpetually inebriated soldier is given the Village, by Caesar's hand, which he promptly sells to an innkeeper for wine.
Pushed by his dominant wife, the innkeeper sells his property and attempts to claim the village as his own.
Upon discovering that his ownership is void, he campaigns to be elected chief, causing rivalries to ensue throughout the village.
To complicate matter, the soldier returns and asks the local legions' aid in reclaiming his village, since he didn't get enough wine for it.

1975 – Asterix and the Great Crossing (La Grande traversée) North America  Brewing the magical potion requires fresh fish, and Unhygienix has none since he imports it from Lutetia (Paris) (in spite of living near the sea).
Asterix and Obelix sail out to catch fish, but become lost and end up on the other side of the ocean, discovering a New World, where they eventually become a legend to the Native American populace.
Soon afterwards, a Viking explorer discovers America, and captures the first natives he finds (i.e. them) and brings them home.
A running joke in this comic is that none of the races are able to understand one another, the Vikings speaking with Scandinavian vowels that the Gauls are unable to duplicate, but that their dogs are able to communicate perfectly.

1976 – Obelix and Co. (Obélix et Compagnie) no travels; a satire of economics  Caesar sends one of his advisors to the Gaulish village, in an effort to make them rich, decadent and utterly dependent on Rome.
He starts by buying menhirs at ever-increasing prices, thus persuading most of the village to make useless menhirs, and in turn employing other villagers to hunt for their food.
The plan goes awry when Caesar's treasury turns out insufficient to fund the menhirs, and a commercial campaign to sell them in Rome fails because of competition from Egyptian menhirs and slave-made Roman menhirs.

1979 – Asterix in Belgium (Astérix chez les Belges) Belgium  When Vitalstatistix hears that Caesar has said that the Belgians are the bravest of all the Gaulish peoples he heads to Belgium in a huff to show the world that his Armoricans are really the best.
After the death of Goscinny, Uderzo continued the series by himself, writing his own stories on subjects such as feminism and aliens, with travels to India and Atlantis.
These newer books are often criticised for lacking Goscinny's humor and writing style, and some fans consider the series ended with Asterix in Belgium.
However, sales figures have shown no indication of diminished popularity.

1980 – Asterix and the Great Divide (Le Grand fossé) A fictional Gaulish village  Asterix and Obelix visit a village divided in half by its rival chiefs.
However, one chief's son and the other's daughter are in love, and together with Asterix and Obelix, they reunite the village.
The dividing chasm itself resembles the Berlin Wall.
There is also an obvious reference here to Romeo and Juliet.

1981 – Asterix and the Black Gold (L'Odyssée d'Astérix) The Middle East, Jerusalem.
Getafix has run out of rock oil and sends Asterix and Obelix to Mesopotamia in search of it.
They are accompanied by a Gaulish-Roman druid called Dubbelosix, who is really a double agent seeking to foul their mission.
Includes a tribute to Goscinny, who was Jewish.

1983 – Asterix and Son (Le Fils d'Astérix) no travels  A baby boy mysteriously turns up at Asterix's doorstep.
No one in the village knows who he is, so Asterix is forced to be his adoptive father.
Meanwhile, the Roman legions led by Brutus are after the baby, because in reality, he is Caesar's full-blooded son, Caesarion.

1991 – Asterix and the Secret Weapon (La Rose et le glaive) No travels  A feminist satire in which a female bard called Bravura replaces Cacofonix as school teacher and "liberates" the village women, causing the men to leave and live in the forest.
Caesar secretly sends a battalion of female legionaries to conquer the village, having heard that the Gauls will not strike a woman.
The men and woman have to settle their differences in order to overcome this threat.

1996 – Asterix and Obelix All at Sea (La Galère d'Obélix) Atlantis  Left alone in Getafix's hut, Obelix drinks a whole cauldron of magic potion.
He first turns to stone, then into a small boy.
Meanwhile, a group of men have escaped from Roman slavery on board a ship.
Together, they travel to Atlantis to make Obelix a grown man again.

2005 – Asterix and the Falling Sky (Le ciel lui tombe sur la tête) no travels  Two rival outer space alien ships appear above the Gaulish village.
The aliens want to know the secret of the great weapon the Gauls have, which is "known throughout the universe".
The aliens are styled on the happy-faced Walt Disney and Marvel Comics superheroes of the American comic book style on one side, and futuristic robot and insect-like Japanese manga style on the other.
The album is explained by Uderzo as a tribute to Walt Disney, who inspired him to be an artist.
Reception of the album was mixed, with many fans criticizing the sci-fi setting, and thinly veiled references to the Bush regime.
Despite this criticism, the album was not disliked by everyone, and reportedly sold well.

In the mid 1980s a series of illustrated text stories appeared, with some original art, but mostly taken and modified from existing albums.
These were 26 pages in a smaller format than the normal albums with large print.
They are aimed at a younger audience and were not enthusiastically received; translation into other languages was spotty.

1984 - Les Pirates (The Pirates)  1985 - L'illustrissime Belcantus (The Illustrious Belacantus)  1985 - L'abominable horrifix (The Dreadful Horrifix)  1985 - Jericocorix (The Jericocorix)  1986 - La course de chars (The Great Chariot Race)  1986 - Le feu de pommes (The Apple Cider)  1986 - Marmaille et pagaille (Kids and Chaos)  1986 - L'eau du ciel (Water from Heaven)  In 1989 a final illustrated story appeared.
The story was by Goscinny (in 1965) with new, original art by Uderzo.
It was 32 pages and appeared in the larger format used for the regular albums.
It was the only one that was published in English:</entry>
  <entry author_id="7681128" end="99" start="83">The Adventures of Asterix (French: Astérix or Astérix le Gaulois) is a series of French comic strips by René Gascony (stories) and Albert Udders (illustrations).
Uderzo has continued the series since the death of Goscinny in 1977.
The series follows the exploits of a village of ancient Galls as they resist Roman occupation.
They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength.
This is often used for comic effect, as in a recurring sequence where the villagers sally forth from their village to rout the attacking Romans so easily as to consider it great sport.
In many cases, this resistance leads the main characters to travel to various European countries (but also Egypt, America, India and other non-European locations) in every other book, while the remaining are set in and around their village.

Uderzo has continued the series since the death of Goscinny in 1977.
The series follows the exploits of a village of ancient Gauls as they resist Roman occupation.
They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength.
This is often used for comic effect, as in a recurring sequence where the villagers sally forth from their village to rout the attacking Romans so easily as to consider it great sport.
In many cases, this resistance leads the main characters to travel to various European countries (but also Egypt, America, India and other non-European locations) in every other book, while the remaining are set in and around their village.

The 33 main books or albums (one of which is a compendium of short stories) have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects.
Besides the original French, most albums are available in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese (and Brazilian Portuguese), Italian, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, modern Greek, Turkish, Slovenian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Croatian.
Beyond modern Europe, some albums have also been translated into languages as diverse as Esperanto, Indonesian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Latin and Ancient Greek.

In France, in Finland, Poland and especially in Germany, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional dialects, such as Alsatian in France, Swabian and Low German in Germany, Kashubian and Silesian in Poland and Savo, Karelia, Rauma and Helsinki slang dialects in Finland.
Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, Asterix the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese.
Hungarian-language books have been issued in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia.
Although not a fully autonomic dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary.
In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the Cretan Greek and Pontic Greek dialects and in Ancient Greek.needed

The Asterix series is one of the most popular French comics in the world, and familiar to people of all ages in most European countries, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and parts of South America, Africa and Asia particularly, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, South Africa, Kenya, Philippines, Singapore, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Asterix is less well known in the United States and Japan.

The Asterix series is one of the most popular French comics in the world, and familiar to people of all ages in most European countries, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and parts of South America, Africa and Asia particularly, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, South Africa, Kenya, Philippines, Singapore, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Asterix is less well known in the United States and Japan.
In its early years the Disney Channel aired the British-produced English translations of the Asterix films; it received modest success in establishing a foothold with American audiences.needed

The Adventures of Asterix (French: Astérix or Astérix le Gaulois) is a series of French comic strips by René Goscinny (stories) and Albert Uderzo (illustrations).
Uderzo has continued the series since the death of Goscinny in 1977.
The series follows the exploits of a village of ancient Gauls as they resist Roman occupation.
They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength.
This is often used for comic effect, as in a recurring sequence where the villagers sally forth from their village to rout the attacking Romans so easily as to consider it great sport.
In many cases, this resistance leads the main characters to travel to various European countries (but also Egypt, America, India and other non-European locations) in every other book, while the remaining are set in and around their village.

The 33 main books or albums (one of which is a compendium of short stories) have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects.
Besides the original French, most albums are available in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese (and Brazilian Portuguese), Italian, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, modern Greek, Turkish, Slovenian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Croatian.

  <entry author_id="14945095" end="703" start="691">A range of scientific articles deals with various aspects.
The historical context, the language, the general role for the development of illustrated literature, issues of translation of humouristic puns and play of words, as well as the translation into the medium film are analysed.
Less seriously, the two contributions deal with traumal brain injuries (TBI) and the series in view of chemical engineering and production.
Marcel Kamp (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf) and coworkers analysed all cases of TBI in Acta Neurochirurgica (Bd.
153, S. 1351).
Overall, 704 cases are reported of 50 years.
None of which left permanent damage.
In conclusion, the majority of injuries could have been prevented by using the chin strap of their helmets, preventing loss before the injury.
A lesson for modern work environment is obvious.
The analysis of the series in view of case studies in the chemical industry is carried out by Leuchs et al.
(DECHEMA Research Institute and LTT RWTH Aachen University) in Chemie Ingenieur Technik.
The authors advocate reading, as up to date topics such as the change of raw material base for the chemical industry, carbon dioxide sequestration, loss of process know-how are addressed.</entry>
