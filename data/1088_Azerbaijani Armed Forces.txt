PARP related activities were aimed at engaging Azerbaijan more closely to NATO's defence planning for operations.
Since then Azerbaijani Armed Forces are undertaking increasing number of so-called Partnership Goals (PG) based on two-year cycles.
PG are focused on achieving military interoperability with NATO troops through introduction of NATO's political-military, military, training and technical standards.

In 2002 NATO/EAPC Prague Summit adopted Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) instrument in order to improve cooperation with the Partner nations.
In May 2003 Azerbaijan formally applied for joining the IPAP.
In May 2004 President of Azerbaijan H.E.
Mr. Ilham Aliyev officially submitted the IPAP Presentation Document to the Alliance, which included comprehensive information on the current status of political, economic and security developments in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan and NATO elaborated and approved the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) in May 2005, on the basis of this Presentation Document.
The IPAP covers all major political, defence, security and security related economic, scientific and environmental spheres.
IPAP implementation and update is based on two-year cycles and annual assessment reports, which are considered at the level of North Atlantic Council +Azerbaijan.

In August 2007 Azerbaijan has completed first IPAP cycle.
The new IPAP document was approved in March 2008.
Since the adoption of the first IPAP of Azerbaijan in May 2005 real steps have been made towards its successful implementation, including in the sphere of security sector reform.
Taking together all the fields of cooperation, progress of Azerbaijan on implementation of IPAP has been considerable.

- Work on the National Security Concept has been completed and it was subsequently endorsed by the Government and Parliament on 19 May 2007.
The work on the Military doctrine is close to finalisation.
These two fundamental documents will guide the Strategic Defence Review of the security sector.

- Despite the on-going conflict, the process of gradual transformation of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan has been started.
Structural changes on the basis of NATO standarts are under way within MOD, General Staff and army units.
It is planned to complete this process in 2009 integrating needs and requirements identified within the Strategic Defence Review (SDR).

With regard to the future of the Partnership and the policy of NATO in the region, Azerbaijan considers that the security in Euro-Atlantic area depends on improvement of the capacity of crises management, creation of secure transport corridors, and development of energy security.
All of these are essential for the development of Partnership as an institution.
The development of Partnership has to give opportunity for the development of security cooperation with NATO on the basis of 3 pillars: political unanimity, legal harmony, practical interoperability.
