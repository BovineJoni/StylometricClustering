The Russian composer, Piotr Ilyitch Tchaikovsky (1840-1893), included four optional single-action diatonic accordions in his Orchestral Suite No.
2 in C Major, op.
53 (1883), simply to add a little color to the third movement: Scherzo burlesque.

In 1915, the American composer, Charles Ives (1874-1954), used a chorus of diatonic accordions (or concertinas) -- along with two pianos, celesta, harp, organ, zither and an optional theremin -- in his Orchestral Set No.

The accordion part -- written for the right-hand only -- consists of eighteen measures at the very end of the eighteen-minute-long three-movement work.
All the above works were written for the diatonic button accordion.

The first composer to write specifically for the chromatic accordion was Paul Hindemith (1895-1963).
In 1921 he included the harmonium in Kammermusik No.
1, a chamber work in four movements for twelve players, but later rewrote the harmonium part for accordion.
Other German composers also used the accordion.
In 1922 the Austrian composer, Alban Berg (1885-1935), included a short on-stage accordion part in his landmark opera Wozzeck, op.

The instrument -- marked Ziehharmonika bzw.
Akkordeon in the score -- appears only during the tavern garden (wirthausgarten) scene, along with an on-stage (Bühnenmusik) ensemble consisting of: two fiddles (violins tuned up a tone), one clarinet in C, one guitar and one bombardon in F (or bass tuba), to lend a touch of authenticity to the deutsche bier garten setting.

Other composers who used the accordion during the first half of the 20th century were: Virgil Thomson: Four Saints in Three Acts (1928), Dmitri Shostakovich: Jazz Suite No.
2 (1938), Serge Prokofiev: Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution, op.
74 (1936), Paul Dessau: Mother Courage (1936) and Die Verurteilung von Lucullus (1949), Jean Françaix: Apocalypse According to St. John (1939), Darius Milhaud: Prelude and Postlude for "Lidoire" (1946), Henry Brant: All Soul's Carnival (1949), to name a few.
Despite efforts by accordion performers and organizations to present the accordion as a serious instrument to the classical music world, the much-coveted breakthrough into the mainstream of serious musical circles did not take place until after leading accordionists abandoned the stradella-bass accordion and embraced the free-bass accordion -- an instrument which was infinitely more attractive to composers.

Although free-bass accordions had been manufactured by Hohner since 1912, the instrument did not really become popular until the mid-twentieth century; when it was "discovered" by classical accordionists.
The Danish accordionist, Mogens Ellegaard (1935-1995) -- who is regarded by many as the father of the avant-garde accordion movement -- described his introduction to the new accordion: "When I started, there was absolutely no accordion culture.
Unless, you define accordion culture as 'oom-pah-pah,' or the Cuckoo Waltz -- that sort of thing.
The free-bass accordion didn't exist -- it was entirely unknown when I was a child.
At that time the accordion world was living in splendid isolation.
No contact at all with the outside musical world.
Concerts for us consisted of Frosini, Deiro repertoire or folkloristic music.
The possibilities of getting a formal, quality education accordion were nil.
The accordion was not accepted at any of the higher music institutions....
The possibilities for a soloist, for the best players, would be variety 'night club' work, Saturday night shows....
This is what I was doing when I was very young."
Ellegaard continued, "But in 1953 the first free-bass accordions were introduced in Denmark and, by coincidence, I was one of the first students to get such an instrument....
In 1957, the pianist Vilfred Kjaer, who was also well-known in our country as a composer of light music, wrote a concerto for me and through his good connections, he was able to organize the world premiere of Jubilesse infameuse.
It was a work of light character, but anyway a beginning.
At that concert, also by coincidence, composer Ole Schmidt was sitting in the audience.
He didn't like Kjaer's composition, but liked the instrument, and told me this bluntly afterwards.
So I challenged him to write something better.
In 1958 he wrote Symphonic Fantasy and Allegro, op.
20 for accordion and orchestra, which was the first really serious work for accordion written by a good composer."

Symphonic Fantasy and Allegro was premiered by the Danish Radio Symphony with the composer conducting.
Ole Schmidt (b.
1928) made the following comment about the work, "I hated accordion until I met Mogens Ellegaard.
He made me decide to write an accordion concerto for him."

Other Danish composers soon followed Schmidt: Niels Viggo Bentzon (b.
1919) wrote Concerto for Accordion (1962-63), In the Zoo (1964) and Sinfonia concertante (1965) for six accordions, string orchestra and percussion.
Per Nørgård (b.
1932) wrote Anatomic Safari (1967) for solo accordion and Recall (1968) for accordion and orchestra, which was dedicated to Lars Dyremose, director of the Danish Accordion Academy.
Karl Aage Rasmussen (b.
1947) wrote Invention (1972), and Hans Abrahamsen (b.
1952) wrote Canzone (1977-8) for solo accordion.
Nørgård's student, Steen Pade (b.
1956), wrote a concerto for accordion and three solo works: Excursions With Detours (1984), Aprilis (1987) and Cadenza (1987).
Vagn Holmboe (b.
1909) wrote Sonata, op.
