Peasant parties first appeared across Eastern Europe between 1860 and 1910, when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society, and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers.
Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it.
They also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands, and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements.
Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties, because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.

In Bulgaria, Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BANU) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives.
BANU came to power in 1919 and introduces many economic, social, and legal reforms.
However conservative forces crushed BANU in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, Aleksandar Stamboliyski (1879–1923).
BANU was made into a Communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.

In Czechoslovakia the Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants often power in parliament as a partner in the five-party pětka coalition.
The part's leader Antonin Švehla (1873–1933) was prime minister several times.
The party was banned in 1945.

In Romania, in 1919 older parties from Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia merged to become the National Peasant Party.
Iuliu Maniu (1873–1953) was prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928 to 1930, but the Great Depression made proposed reforms impossible.
The Communists dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after Communism collapsed.

Leopold was born in 1887 and educated at Yale University.
He developed the field of game management and introduced an ecological ethic that replaced an earlier wilderness ethic where human dominance is stressed.
In addition, he included the farm as a place of conservation and is considered an agrarian scholar.
Leopold believed that harm was frequently done to natural systems out of a sense of ownership and this idea eclipsed community.
He expanded the idea of community to include the environment and the farm.
Leopold is the author of several essays and is perhaps best know for his book A Sand County Almanac.

Wendell Berry's is an author of several books, essays, and poems whose writing often illustrates his values which center around sustainable agriculture, healthy rural communities, and a connection to place.
He is a prominent defender of agrarian values and has an appreciation for traditional farming.
Rod Dreher writes the following: “ unshakable devotion to the land, to localism, and to the dignity of traditional life makes him both a great American and, to the disgrace of our age, a prophet without honor in his native land."

Callicott is, perhaps, best known for his research which explores an Aldo Leopold ethic as a response to global climate change.
Callicott supports a holistic, non-anthropocentric environmental ethic which is in accordance with Leopold's view that "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.
It is wrong when it tends otherwise" He holds the view that an adequate environmental ethic — one that addresses actual environmental concerns — must be intrinsically holistic.

Paul Thompson is the W.K.
Kellogg Chair in Agricultural Food and Community Ethics at Michigan State University.
He has published extensively on the social and environmental significance of agriculture.
He has published a number of volumes and papers on the philosophical significance of farming, notably The Spirit of the Soil: Agriculture and Environmental Ethics (1995) and The Agrarian Roots of Pragmatism (2000).
His most recient publication called The Agrarian Vision focuses on sustainability and what agrarian philosophy can offer when we conceptualize what sustainability actually means.

In Russia the intellectuals of the "Populists" (Narodnaya Volya) and, later, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party developed a theoretical basis for a peasant movement, building a rich, well-developed humanistic ideology which influenced eastern Europe, especially the Balkans.
It never attained the international visibility among peasants that socialism did among the urban workers.

The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time.
New Zealand never had an aristocracy but it did have wealthy landowners who largely controlled politics before 1891.
The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called "populism."
Richard Seddon had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: "It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes.
That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand."
The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small land-owning farmers who supported Liberal ideals.
The First Liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state, with old age pensions, developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions.
In 1893 it extended voting rights to women, making New Zealand the first country in the world to enact universal female suffrage.

To obtain land for farmers the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased 3.1 million acres of Maori land.
The government also purchased 1.3 million acres from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers.
The Advances to Settlers Act of 1894 provided low-interest motgages, while the Agriculture Department disseminated information on the best farming methods.
The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, antimonopoly land policy.
The policy built up support for the Liberal party in rural North Island electorates.
By 1903 the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.
