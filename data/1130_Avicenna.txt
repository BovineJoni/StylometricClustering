bü ‘Au al-Husain ibn ‘Abdallãh ibn SInä] (980—103 7), Arabian philosopher, was born at Afshena in the district of Bokhara.
His mother was a native of the place; his father, a Persian from Balkh, filled the post of tax-collector in the neighbouring town of Harmaitin, under Nuh II.
ibn Mansur, the Samanid amir of Bokhara.
On.
the birth of Avicenna’s younger brother the family migrated to Bokhara, then one of the chief cities of the Moslem world, and famous for a culture which was older than its conquest by the Saracens.
Avicenna was put in charge of a tutor,,and his precocity soon made him the marvel of his neighbours,—as a boy of ten who knew by rote the Koran and much Arabic poetry besides.
From a greengrocer he learnt arithmetic; and higher branches were begun under one of those wandering scholars who gained a livelihood by cures for the sick and lessons for the young.
Under him Avicenna read the Isagoge of Porphyry and the first propositions of Euclid.
But the pupil Soon found his teacher to be but a charlatan, and betook himself, aided by commentaries, to master logic, geometry and the Almagest.
Before he was sixteen he not merely knew medical theory, but by gratuitous attendance on the sick had, according to his own accoun.t, discovered new methods of treatment.
For the next year and a half he worked at the higher philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles.
In such moments of baffled inquiry he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then hie to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties.
Deep into the night he would continue his studies, stimulating his senses by occasional cups of wine, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution.
Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination.
from the little commentary by Fgr~bi (q.v.
), which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhems.
So great was his joy at the discovery, thus made by help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed an alms upon the poor.
Thus, by the end of his seventeenth year his apprenticeship of study was

His first appointment was that of physician to the amir, who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness (997).
Avicenna’s chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids (q.v.
), well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars.
When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Avicenna accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge.
Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labours, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.

At the age of twenty-two Avicenna lost his father.
The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004.
Avicenna seems to have declined the offers of Mahmüd the Ghaznevid, and proceeded westwards to Urjensh in the modern Khiva, where the vizier, regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend.
But the pay was small, and Avicenna wandered from place to place through the districts of Nishapur and Merv to the borders of J(horasan, seeking an opening for his talents.
Shams al-Ma’äli Qäbtis, the generous ruler of Dailam, himself a poet and a scholar, with whom he had expected to find an asylum, was about that date (1052) starved to death by his own revolted soldiery.
Avicenna himself was at this season stricken down by a severe illness.
Finally, at Jorjan, near the Caspian, he met with a friend, who bought near his own house a dwelling in which Avicenna lectured on logic and astronomy.
For this patron several of his treatises were written; and the commencement of his Canon of Medicine also dates from his stay in Hyrcania.

He subsequently settled at Rai, in the vicinity of the modern Teheran, where a son of the last amir, Majd Addaula, was nominal ruler, under the regency of his mother.
At Rai about thirty of his shorter works are said to have been composed.
But the constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, Shams Addaula, compelled the scholar to quit the place, and after a brief sojourn at Kazwin, he passed southwards to Hamadãn, where that prince had established himself.
At first he entered into the service of a high-born lady; but ere long the amir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling.
Avicenna was even raised to the office of vizier; but the turbulent soldiery, composed of Kurds and Turks, mutinied against their nominal sovereign, and demanded that the new vizier should be put to death.
Shams Addaula consented that he should be banished from the country.
Avicenna, however, remained hidden for forty days in a sheik’s house, till a fresh attack of illness induced the amir to restore him to his post.
Even during this perturbea time he prosecuted his studies and teaching.
Every evening extracts from his great works, the Canon and the Sanatio, were dictated and explained to his pupils; among whom, when the lesson was over, he spent the rest of the night in festive enjoyment with a band of singers and players.
On the death of the amir Avicenna ceased to be vizier, and hid himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.
Meanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya’far, the prefect of Isfahan, offering his services; but the new amir of Hamadgn getting to hear of this correspondence, and discovering the place of Avicenna’s concealment, incarcerated him in a fortress.
War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamadan; in 1024 the former captured Hamadãn and its towns, and expelled the Turkish mercenaries.
When the storm had passed Avicenna returned with the amir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labours; but at length, accompanied by his brother, a favourite pupil, and two slaves, made his escape out of the city in the dress of a Sufite ascetic.
After a perilous journey they reached ~sfahan, and received an honourable welcome from the prince.
The remaining ten or twelve years of Avicenna’s life were spent in the service of Abu Ya’far ‘Ala Addaula, whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.
During these years he began to study literary matters and philology.

criticisms on his style.
But amid his restless study Avicenna never forgot his love of enjoyment.
Unusual bodily vigour enabled him to combine severe devotion to work with facile indulgence in sensual pleasures.
His passion for wine and women was almost as well known as his learning.
Versatile, lighthearted, boastful and pleasure-loving, he contrasts with the nobler and more intellectual character of Averroes.
His bouts of pleasure gradually weakened his constitution; a severe colic, which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Avicenna could scarcely stand.
On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.
On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and every third day till his death listened to the reading of the Koran.
He died in June 1037, in his fiftyeighth year, and was buried in Hamadãn.

It was mainly accident which determined that from the 12th to the 17th century Avicenna should be the guide of medical study in European universities, and eclipse the names of Rhazes, Ali ibn al-Abbas and Avenzoar.
His work is not essentially different from that of his predecessors Rhazes and Au; all present the doctrine of Galen, and through Galen the doctrine of Hippocrates, modified by the system of Aristotle.
~nt the Canon of Avicenna is distinguished from the Al-Hawi (Continens) or Summary of Rhazes by its greater method, due perhaps to the logical studies of the former, and entitling him to his surname Of Prince of the Physicians.
The work has been.
variously appreciated in.
subsequent ages, some regarding it as a treasury of wisdom, and others, like Avenzoar, holding it useful only as waste paper.
In modern times it has been more criticized than read.
The vice of the book is excessive classification of bodily faculties, and over-subtlety in the discrimination of diseases.
It includes five books; of which the first and second treat of physiology, pathology and hygiene, the third and fourth deal with the methods of treating disease, and the fifth describes the composition and preparation of remedies.
This last part contains some contingent of personal observation.
He is, like alihis countrymen, ample in,the enumeration of symptoms, and is said to be inferior to Ali in practical medicine and surgery.
He introduced into medical theory the four causes of the Peripatetic system.
Of natural history and botany he pretends to no special knowledge.
Up to the year 1650, or thereabouts, the Canon was still used as a text-hook in the universities of Louvain and Montpellier.

About 100 treatises are ascribed to Avicenna.
Some of them are tracts of a few pages, others are works extending through several volumes.
The best-known amongst them, and that to which Avicenna owed ‘his European reputation, is the Canon of Medicine; an Arabic edition of it appeared at Rome in 1593, and a Hebrew version at Naples in 1491.
Of the Latin version there were about thirty editions, founded on the original translation by Gerard of Cremona.
The 15th century has the honour of composing the great commentary on the text of the Canon, grouping around it all that theory had imagined, and all that practice had observed.
Other medical works translated into Latin are the Medicamenta Co-rdialia, Canticum de Medicina, Tractatus de Syrupo Acetoso.
Scarcely any member of the Arabian circle of the sciences, including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics and music, was left untouched by the treatises of Avicenna, many of which probably varied little, except in being commissioned by a different patron and having a different form or extent.
He wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him.
His book on animals was translated by Michael Scot.
His Logic, Metaphysics, Physics, De Caelo, are treatises giving a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine.
The Logic and Metaphysics have been printed more than.

Two encyclopaedic

treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned.
The arger, Al-S hif a’ (Sanatio), exists nearly complete in manuscript n the Bodleian library and elsewhere; part of it on the De An-ima appeared at Pavia (1490) as the Liber Sextus Nat uralium, md the long account of Avicenna’s philosophy given.
by Shahrastani seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa’.
A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (Liberatio).
The Latin editions of part Df these works have been modified by the corrections which the monkish editors confess that they applied.
There is also a Philosophia Orientalis, mentioned by Roger Bacon, and now Lost, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.

(XV.
W.; G. W. T.)

The philosophy of Avincenna, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to Aristotle and to Al-Farabi.
The search for an arab philosophy and for a personal mysticism can be ascertained from what is left to us of his work.
Islamic philosophy, imbued as it is with theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism the difference between essence and existence.
Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence is that which endures within a being beyond the accidental.
For Avincenna, essence is non-contingent.
For an essence to be realised within time (as an existence), the existence must be rendered necessary by the essence itself.
This particular relationship of cause and effect is due to an inherent property of the essence, that it is non-contingent.
For existence in general to be possible, there must exist a necessary essence, itself uncaused - a being or God to begin a process of emanation.

This view has a profound impact on the monotheistic concept of creation.
Existence is not seen by Avincenna as the work of a capricious deity, but of a divine, self-causing thought process.
The movement from this to existence is necessary, and not an act of will per se.
The world emanates from God by virtue of his abundant intellect - an immaterial cause as found in the neoplatonic concept of emanation.

This Ninth Intellect occurs at a step so removed from the First Intellect that the emanation that then arises from it explodes into fragments, creating not a further celestial entity, but instead creating human souls, which have the sensory functions lacked by the Angels of Magnificence.
For Avincenna, human minds are not in themselves formed for abstract thought.
Man is intellectually only potentially, and only illumination by the Angel confers upon them the ability to make from this potential a real ability to think.
This is the Tenth Intellect.

The degree to which minds are illuminated by the Angel varies.
Prophets are illuminated to the point that they posses not only rational intellect, but also an imagination and ability which allows them to pass on their superior wisdom to others.
Some recieve less, but enough to write, teach, pass laws, and contribute to the distribution of knowledge.
Others recieve enough for their own personal realisation, and others still receive less.

On this view, all humanity shares a single agent intellect - a collective consciousness.
The final stage of human life, accoring to Avincenna, is reunion with the emanation of the Angel.
Thus, the Angel confers upon those imbued with its intellect the certainty of life after death.
For Avincenna, as for the neoplatonists who influenced him, the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill.

The period of the following in the wake of Ibn Sina's Peripatetic philosophy in the 11th and 12th.
At this time Ash'ari theology was predominant in the eastern Islamic lands.
Of course as Henry Corbin mentions Avicennism didn't faded by such criticisms in Muslim world especially in Iran.

On the other hand Suhrwaardi followed Avicenna's attempts to build "Oriental philosophy"(Hikmat al-Mashriqia), a project which according to Suhrwardi, could never had completed because he was ignorant of true oriental sources, the philosophy of light ancient Persia.
His essentialistic approach led to a new philosophy which is known as School of Illumination.
As Suhrwardi wrote in the beginning of "Story of western loneliness" he starts the story from where Avicenna ended in story of Hayy ibn Yaqdhan.

In the 13th CE Avicennism revived by the efforts of Nasir al-Din Tusi.
But this Avicenna is interpreted in the life of the ideas of Suhrwardi and Ibn Arabi and differs with rationalist Avicenna who is known in the Europe.
In the 16th CE Mulla Sadra innovated a new philosophical system which combined the vision of Sufi metaphysics and rationalistic Peripatetic approach of Avicenna.
He also solved some of major problems in Avicennism such as bodily resurrection.
Up to 20th century Islamic philosophy emphasized on ontology, but at this time Allameh Tabatabaei added epistemology to it in The principles of philosophy and method of Realism.
He tried to built realistic epistemology which is compatible with the former ideas.

Avicenna flourished in special scholar circumstances which was the culmination of scholar activities in Islamic golden age.
The translation and interpretation of classical thoughts has been done.
The period witnessed the introduction and assimilation of Hellenistic, Persian, and Hindu mathematics, astronomy, algebra, trigonometry, and medicine into Muslim culture.
The 10th and 11th were centuries of interpretation, criticism, and further adaptation.
Samanid dynasty in Greater Khorasan and central Asia as well as Buwayhid on in western part of Persia and Iraq could provide good atmosphere for scholar and cultural works.
Under the Samanids, Bukhara rivaled Baghdad as a cultural capital of Islam.

Study of Quran and Hadith as well as Fiqh and theology were completely developed.
al-Razi and Al-Farabi provide methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy.
Avicenna could use of the great libraries in Balkh, Khwarezm, Gorgan, Rey, Isfahan and Hamedan.
He also could meet and speak the greatest scholars of the time.
As Aruzi Samarqandi describes in his four articles before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met al-Biruni(great scientist and astronomer), Abu Nasr Iraqi(great mathematician), Abu Sahl Masihi(great philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar(great physician).
