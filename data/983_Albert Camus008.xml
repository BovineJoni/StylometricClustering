In 1935 he founded () that survived to 1939.

He resigned from 1947 when it had become a commercial paper.

After the war, Camus became one member of Sartre’s entourage and frequented on the Boulevard St. Germain in Paris.
Camus also toured United States to lecture about French existentialism.
Although he leaned left politically, he was not a member of any particular party and his strong criticisms about communist doctrine did not win any friends in the communist parties.
Eventually this also alienated Sartre.
