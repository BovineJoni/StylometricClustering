This implies that the fundamental quantities that our brains are comprised of cannot actually be destroyed.
However, it is certainly observed that the specific composition of those quantities which produces the electromagnetic currents and fields thought to comprise consciousness and cognition do change after death to forms that no longer produce these currents and fields, which presents the question: Is consciousness a sole result of the specific configuration of matter of a living brain, or do other forms of matter or energy possess forms of consciousness as well?
If the latter is true, even in part, then it is not certain that the subjective experience of a being's consciousness ends at the time of death, which could be strongly interpreted as a form of afterlife.

Also, the nature of consciousness and sentience itself is a subject of wide debate, and not agreed upon by any means.
While the major monotheistic religions of the world (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and their offshoots) almost universally preach some form of mind-body dualism, many "Eastern" religions, such as the many branches of Buddhism and Taoism do not contain any such claims, and may in fact preach ideologies that are opposed to it.
Zen Buddhism in particular is famous for koans and parables that are meant to teach that the nature of consciousness is transient and/or illusory, with some schools going so far as to say that even the concept of a "self" is fundamentally flawed.
Philosophical conceptions such as these, which reject mind-body dualism and contain ideas of life and existence separate from a "self" or unique soul, remove in large part one of the major criticisms of scientific individuals regarding the afterlife - namely, that an individual must have a soul in order to experience consciousness after death.
These are active topics of debate both in philosophy and the emerging field of cognitive science.

The emerging field of artificial intelligence in computing presents interesting questions regarding an experience of afterlife, as well: If a robot is created which possesses cognition and problem-solving comparable to a human, is that robot considered conscious or "alive"?
If so, can he, she, or it "die"?
The memories of such robots, if they are ever constructed, could theoretically be composed of some form of electronic storage and stored on devices identical in purpose to modern hard drives, which can be completely copied in a matter of seconds or hours.
If a backup is made of such a theoretical robot's memory at some point, and that robot's current memory is damaged, destroyed, or rendered inoperable, in what sense, if any, does the newly restored robot's experience constitute resurrection?
Assuming that artificial intelligence research continues at the rapid pace it has shown so far, these and related questions may become quite meaningful in the future.</entry>
  <entry author_id="2003269" end="57" start="14">The concept of a life after death is propaganda used by political and religious groups to recruit people to their respective causes and keep them in their control.
Death itself, as a philosophical topic, has no value.
The soul, which is the purported medium of transfer to an afterlife, is an invention used to sway people away from confronting absolute mortality, which is the only logical and demonstrable conclusion to be drawn from death.
Any attempt to dissuade this conclusion must be based on a complete rejection of all humanity's observed empirical evidence.
In addition any discussion of life after death can only be continued through unfounded musings.
No one has died and been scientifically determined to have returned from the dead, religious beliefs notwithstanding.
Nonetheless death, unlike birth, has meaning to the individual.
Death too is sensed by the individual through observation and extrapolation.
Social affirmation, begun through acceptable parental behavior, brings value to life while lack of this affirmation devalues life, developing a concern for and consequent resistance to the acceptance of death as a natural occurrence.
Attempting to overcome death by virtue of philosophical, primarily religious, education puts us in a position of denying life.
Unlike life we can never know death, regardless that many defend any number of beliefs.
Acceptance of the cessation of life completely and entirely, on an individual basis, is the only way any person can develop full human value and respect for life.
Individual life has immeasurable value, however this value is demeaned to that of a puppet, when pursued without understanding that death of the body is the cessation of the self conscious being.
An individual's life, if followed without understanding that death of our bodies is death of our being, becomes a show with someone else always pulling the strings.
Religion's concept, denying death as terminal, is the single most severe problem confronting humanity.
Before any solutions to collective problems can be reached, personal acceptance of mortality must be resolved.
There will be no answers to any human problems, so long as we are guided by any philosophy charting a course for immortality.
Mortality is the least common denominator in the human equation.
Religion's complex answers obscure, mislead and hide this reality.
Accepting death, without promise of anything beyond, demands we value life.
As humans we have witnessed the cessation of life in some form from a very early age, on an almost daily level,.
Acknowledging this cessation of animation, consistently observed in the dead or dying life forms, is the first step of personal awareness.
Observation of and reflection on this change, from our earliest years, forms humanity's unique basis of reason.
Self awareness is this very distinct and peculiarly human response our individual organisms have to death.
While we are born human we only achieve humanity by acknowledging death.
We can only understand and begin to respect life through this awareness of death.
Rather than accept self awareness which is bred in the knowledge of death, many become involved in the process of denial.
This process of denial has many venal advantages for those who lead it.
Hierarchies of whatever ilk originate with those who seek to control others, whether through murder, the fear of death or the promise of eternal life.
No life form has any way of knowing or extrapolating any existence after death.
The thought that life does not cease with death will be debated so long as people live in ignorance and consequently in fear.
Greed, murder and religion are the most common social responses to death.
Our inability, or perhaps more correctly our unwillingness, to deal with our absolute mortality has brought about problems with continued human existence.
This avoidance has now placed us on the cusp of our planetary destruction.
We as thinking animals must accept the natural order which rules our planet.
Chaos is not a result of nature, rather our response to nature.
Our minds will be as plants without cultivation until we recognize and utilize, within the utter chance of our existence, the tool of clear thinking to turn our mental soil.
Our ability to survive, stems from acknowledging and respecting the unique existence in each of us.
We must understand and respect ourselves, before we can begin to understand and respect others.
Our awareness of mortality is the first sense we have as individuals.
This awareness of mortality tells us not only that we exist as individuals, but also that others exist beyond our selves.
Acceptance of our personal mortality can lead humanity to an enlightened future.
Denial's invention of gods will only lead to a mass grave.</entry>
  <entry author_id="483850" end="69" start="57">There are many different beliefs about what is after death, and even more recently due to the rise and influence of many more religious sects, cults, and the new age movement.
A few cults have claimed that aliens in spaceships will take us away once we are dead.
Others claim that aliens are breeding us for experiments, or performing tests on us.
There is no end to the imaginary ways that we might truly exist and then die.
We could be time travellers, or forever repeating in an eternal cycling of universes.
Nietzsche wrote about the idea of the eternal return, where we will repeat forever all of our worst and best actions.
There are many books and science fiction writers that dream up an increasing amount of theories about death.
Some examples are the idea that this is all just a dream, or some alien experiment that we will wake up from.
The Matrix movies made the idea of a false notion of being alive very popular.
Star Trek also made the hologram deck idea popular and a possible cause of all that we sense, think, and feel.
Notions of time travellers that can move from one universe to the next have also become more popular.
The idea that the human body can be cloned forever, and that it will never die is also a common science fiction claim.</entry>
  <entry author_id="237572" end="82" start="69">In Tibetan Buddhism the Tibetan Book of the Dead explains the intermediate state of humans between decease and reincarnation.
The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation.
There are various reasons why deceased not follow that light.
Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life.
Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals.
And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness.
In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude and avoid negative ideas.
Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions.
In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts.
No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body.
The deceased get help from different Buddhas who show them the path to the bright light.The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation.
They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before.
It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trusts in the Dharma and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.</entry>

Allahâs own word in the Qurâan is the foundation of this faith.
Besides, the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) explained the centrality of this belief for a person who wishes to lead an Islamic life.

We know that we have no means of knowing life after death as a perceptual experience.
But Allah has given us certain levels of consciousness that provide us with insight into realities not perceptible through the senses.
The Qurâan speaks to our rational mind when it answers the disbelievers who ask, âWho will give life to the dead bones?â The answer is, of course, the One Who created them.

Belief in life after death gives meaning to our life, for it tells us that this life is only a test and preparation for an eternal life.
Furthermore, we know that in the afterlife we will receive justice for all the wrongs we suffer here.
It may seem that the sinful and corrupt are often happier or wealthier than the righteous, but that is only for a short time.
In the afterlife they will get their due.

Belief in life after death encourages a person to lead a good life on earth, since he knows the fate that awaits him if he ignores the commands and warnings of Allah given in the Qurâan.
In fact, belief in the afterlife is the strongest incentive for a person to lead a life of virtue here.
The real road to a peaceful society can be paved only if people believe in an afterlife.

  <entry author_id="4475651" end="114" start="101">Some investigations have been conduced, which indicate that out âout-of-bodyâ experiences in relation to the biological and experiential aspects of death and near-death experiences are only fictions of the mind.
One hospital, in order to validate claims of out-of-body experiences, for example, placed an LED marquee above its patientsâ beds which displayed a hidden message that could only be read if one were looking down from above.

The afterlife played an important role in Ancient Egyptian religion.
Egyptians believed that being mummified was the only way to have an afterlife.
Without it, you would not have one.
The believer had to act well and know the rituals explained in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
If the corpse had been properly embalmed and entombed in a mastaba, the defunct would relive in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun god on its daily ride.
If, during the psychomachia, the souls of the defunct were found faulty, the demon Ammit would eat them.
In addition to being virtuous, however, one also had to know numerous passwords, spells, and formulas to navigate the afterlife successfully.
When the body died, its ka went to the kingdom of dead.
Because of all the dangers, the book of the dead was placed in the tomb.
While the body was in the fields of Yalu, Osiris demanded work as payback for protection he provided.
Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.</entry>

The end of this cycle is Mukti or salvation.
However, not all Hindus believe in reincarnation.

A soul may need to live many lives before

Many Wiccans, though not all, profess a belief in an afterlife called the Summerland, a peaceful and sunny place where the souls of the newly dead are sent.
Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives.
After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased.

The Greek god Hades is known in Greek mythology as the king of the underworld, a bleak place in between the place of torment and the place of rest, where most souls live after death.
Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld.
The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as Pluto.
The Trojan prince Aeneas, who founds the nation that would later become Rome, visits the underworld according to the epic poem Aeneid.</entry>
  <entry author_id="989077" end="276" start="124">Please read a chapter from 'Towards Understanding Islam' by Abul A'la Maudoodi:  Belief in Life After Death The fifth article of Islamic Faith is belief in life after death.
The Prophet Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has directed us to believe in resurrection after death and in the Day of Judgement.
The essential ingredients of this belief, as taught to us by him, are as follows:

That the life of this world and of all that is in it will come to an end on an appointed day.
Everything will be annihilated.
That day is called Qiyamah, i.e. the Last Day.

The Need of this Belief Belief in life after death has always been an integral part of the teachings of the Prophets.
Every Prophet asked his followers to believe in it, in the same way as the last of the Prophets, Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him), has asked us to do.
This has always been an essential condition of being a Muslim.
All Prophets have categorically declared that one who does not believe in it, or casts doubts on it, is a Kafir.
This is so because denial of life after death makes all other beliefs meaningless.
This denial also destroys the very sanction for a good life and man is driven to a life of ignorance and disbelief.
A little reflection makes this quite clear.

In your everyday life, whenever you are asked to do anything, you immediately think: what is the use of doing it and what harm is involved in not doing it?
This is in the very nature of man.
He instinctively regards a useless action as totally unnecessary.
You will never be willing to waste your time and energy in useless and unproductive jobs.
Similarly, you will not be very eager to avoid a thing that is harmless.
And the general rule is that the deeper your conviction about the utility of a thing, the firmer will be your response to it; and the more doubtful you are about its efficacy, the more wavering will be your attitude.
After all, why does a child put his hand into fire?
Because he is not sure that fire burns.
Why does he evade study?
Because he does not fully grasp the importance and benefits of education and does not believe in what his elders try to impress on his mind.

Now think of the man who does not believe in the Day of Judgement.
Will he not consider belief in God and a life in accordance with His code of no consequence?
What value will he attach to a life in pursuit Â«f His pleasure?
To him neither obedience to God is of any advantage, nor disobedience to Him of any harm.
How, then, can it be possible for him to scrupulously follow the injunctions of God, His Prophet, and His Book?
What incentive will there be for him to undergo trials and sacrifices and to avoid worldly pleasures?
And if a man does not follow the code of God and lives according to his own likes and dislikes, of what use is his belief in the existence of God, if indeed he has any such belief?
That is not all.
If you reflect still deeper, you will come to the conclusion that belief in life after death is the most decisive factor in the life of a man.
Its acceptance or rejection determines the very course of his life and behaviour.

But a man who believes in the next world as well and is convinced of the final consequences of his acts will look on all worldly gains and losses as temporary and transitory and will not put his eternal bliss at stake for a passing gain.
He will look on things in their wider perspective and always keep the permanent benefit or harm in view.
He will do the good, however costly it may be to him in terms of worldly gains, or however injurious it may be to his immediate interests: and he will avoid the wrong, however tempting it may look.
He will judge things from the viewpoint of their eternal consequences and not according to his whims and caprices.

Thus there is a radical difference between the beliefs, approaches and lives of the two persons.
One's idea of a good act is limited to whether in this brief temporary life it will bring gain in the shape of money, property, public applause and similar other things which give him position, power, reputation and worldly happiness.
Such things become his objectives in life.
Fulfillment of his own wishes and self-aggrandizement become the be-all and end-all of his life.
And he does not draw back even from cruel and unjust means to achieve his ends.
Similarly, his conception of a wrong act is one, which may involve a risk or injury to his interests in this world such as loss of property and life, harming of health, blackening of reputation or some other unpleasant consequence.

In contrast to this man, the believer's concept of good and evil will be quite different.
To him all that pleases God is good and all that invokes His displeasure and wrath is evil.
A good act, according to him, will remain good even if it brings no benefit to him in this world, or even entails loss of some worldly possession or injury to his -personal interests.
He will be confident that God will reward him in the eternal life and will be the real success.
Similarly, he will not fall prey to evil deeds merely for some worldly gain, for he knows that even if he escapes punishment in his short worldly life, in the end he will be the loser because he will not be able to escape punishment from the court of God.
He does not believe in the relativity of morals but sticks to the absolute standards revealed by God and lives according to them irrespective of gain or injury in this world.

Islam says "In the way of God give charity (zakah) to the poor."
His answer is: "No zakah will lessen my wealth: I will, instead, take interest on my money," And in its collection he will not hesitate to take everything belonging to the debtors however poor or hungry they may be.
Islam says: "Always speak the truth and shun lying, though you may gain ever so much by lying and lose ever so much by speaking the truth."
But his reply will be "Well, what shall I do with a truth which is of no use to me here, and which instead brings loss to me; and why should I avoid lying where it can bring benefit to me without any risk, even that of a bad name?"
He visits a lonely place and finds a precious metal lying there; in such a situation Islam says: "This is not your property, do not take it," but he would say: "This is a thing I have come by without any cost or trouble; why should I not have it?
There is no one to see me pick this up, no one who might report it to the police or give evidence against me in a court of law, or give me a bad name among the people.
Why should I not make use of this valuable?"
Someone secretly keeps a deposit with this man, and eventually he dies.
Islam says: "Be honest with the property deposited with you and give it over to the heirs of the deceased."
He says: "Why?
There is no evidence of his property being with me; his children also have no knowledge of it.
When I can appropriate it without any difficulty, without any fear of legal claim, or stain on my reputation, why should I not do so?"

In short, at every step in life, Islam will direct him to walk in a certain direction and adopt a certain attitude and course of behaviour; but he will go in the opposite direction.
For Islam measures and values everything from the viewpoint of its eternal consequence; while such a person always has in view only the immediate and earthly outcome.
Now, you can understand why a man cannot be a Muslim without belief in the Day of Judgement.
To be a Muslim is d very great thing; the fact is that one cannot even become a good man without this belief, for the denial of the Day of Judgement degrades man from humanity to a place even lower than that of the lowest of animals.

Life After Death: A Rational Vindication So far we have discussed the need and importance of belief in the Day of Judgement.
Now let us consider how far the constituents of the belief are rationally understandable.
The fact is that whatever Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has told us about life after death is clearly borne out by reason.
Although our belief in that Day is based on our implicit trust in the Messenger of God, rational reflection not only confirms this belief but also reveals that Muhammad's (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) teachings in this respect are much more reasonable and understandable than any other viewpoint about life after death.

1.Some people say that there is nothing left of man after death, and that after this life-ending event there is no other life.
According to these people, belief in life after death has no reality.
They say it is scientifically impossible.
This is the view of the atheists who also claim to be scientific in their approach and bring in Western science to support their arguments.

2.Other people maintain that man, in order to bear the consequences of his deeds, is repeatedly regenerated in this world.
If he lives a bad life, he will assume in the next generation the shape of some animal, such as a dog or a cat, or some tree or some lower kind of man.
If his acts have been good, he will be reborn as a man into a higher class.
This viewpoint is found in some Eastern religions.

3.There is a third viewpoint which calls for belie!'
in the Day of Judgement, the Resurrection, man's presence in the Divine Court, and the meting out of reward and punishment.
This is the common belief of all the Prophets.

The first group, which arrogates to itself the authority and support of science, alleges that there is no life after death.
They say that they have never seen anybody coming back from the dead.
After death a man is reduced to dust; therefore, death is the end of life and there is no life after death.
But consider this reasoning: is this really a scientific argument?
Is the claim really founded on reason?
If they have not seen a single case of revival after death, they can only say that they do not know what will happen after death.
But, instead of remaining within this limit, they declare that nothing will happen after death, at the same time alleging that they speak out of knowledge!
In fact they merely generalize on ignorance.
Science tells us nothing â negative or positive â in this respect and their assertion that life after death has no existence is totally unfounded.
Their claim is not dissimilar to the claim of an ignoramus who has not seen an aeroplane and on that 'knowledge' proclaims that aeroplanes do not exist at all!
Because somebody has not seen a thing, it does not mean that that thing does not exist.
No man, not even the whole of humanity, if it has not seen a thing, can claim that such a thing does not, or car-not, exist.
This claim is out and out unscientific.
No reasonable man can give it any weight.

Now look at the beliefs of the second group.
According to them, a human being is a human being because in his previous animal form he had done good deeds; and an animal is an animal because previously as a human being he had behaved badly.
In other words, to be a man or an animal is the consequence of one's deeds in one's former form.
One may well ask "Which of them existed first, man or animal?"
If they say man preceded animal, then they will have to accept that he must have been an animal before that, and was given a human form for its good deeds.
If they say it was animal they will have to concede that there must have been before that a man who was transformed into an animal for his bad deeds.
This leads to a vicious circle; the advocates of this belief cannot settle on any form for the first creature, for every generation implies a preceding generation so that the succeeding generation may be considered as the consequence of the former.
This is simply absurd.

Now consider the third viewpoint.
Its first proposition is: that "this world will one day come to an end.
God will destroy and annihilate the universe, and in its place will evolve another higher and far superior cosmos."

This statement is undeniably true.
No doubt can be cast on it.
The more we reflect on the nature of the cosmos, the more clearly it is proved that the existing system is not permanent and everlasting: all the forces working in it are limited in their nature, and will one day be exhausted.
That is why the scientists agree that one day the sun will become cold and will give up all its energy, stars will collide with one another and the whole system of the universe will be upset and destroyed.
Moreover, if evolution is true in the case of the constituents of this universe, why may it not be true for the whole of it?
To think of the universe becoming totally non-existent is more improbable than that it will pass into another evolutionary stage, and another, much-improved order of things will emerge.

The second proposition of this belief is that "man will again be given life".
Is it impossible?
If so, how did the present life of man become possible?
It is evident that God Who created man in this world can do so in the next.
Not only is it a possibility, it is also a positive necessity, as will be shown later.

The third proposition is that "the record of all the actions of man in this world is preserved and will be presented on the Day of Resurrection".
The proof of the truth of this proposition is provided today by science itself.
The sounds, which we make, produce slight waves in the air and die out.
It has been discovered that the sound leaves its impression on its surrounding objects and can be reproduced.
Gramophone records are made on this principle.
From this it can be understood that the record of every movement of man is being impressed on everything, which comes into contact with the waves produced by the movements.
This shows that the record of all our deeds is completely preserved and can be reproduced.

The fourth proposition is that "on the Day of Resurrection.
God will hold His Court and, with just judgement, reward or punish man for his good and bad deeds".
What is unreasonable about this?
Reason itself demands that God should hold His court and pronounce judgement.
We see men doing good deeds and gaining nothing in this world.
We see other men doing bad deeds and not suffering for it.
Not only this, we see thousands of cases of good acts bringing trouble on the doer, and of bad deeds resulting in the happiness and gratification of the guilty person.
When we notice these events happening every day, our reason and sense of justice demand that a time must come when the man who does good must be rewarded and the one who does evil must be punished.
If you have a tin of petrol and a match- box, you can set fire to the house of your opponent, and apparently escape every consequence.
Does this mean that such an offence has no consequences at all?
Certainly not!
It means only that its physical outcome has appeared, and the moral outcome is hidden.
Do you really think it reasonable that it should never appear?
If you say it should, the question is, where?
Certainly not in this world, where only the physical consequences of actions manifest themselves fully, and rational and moral consequences do not become apparent.

Results and consequences of this higher category can appear only if there comes into existence another order of things wherein rational and moral laws reign supreme and occupy the governing position and where the physical laws are made subject to them.
That is the next world, which, as we have said before, is the next evolutionary stage of the universe.
It is evolutionary in the sense that it will be governed by moral rather than by physical laws.
The rational consequences of man's actions, which are hidden wholly or partly in this world, will then appear.
Man's stature will be determined by his rational and moral worth judged in accordance with his conduct in this life of test and trial.
There you will not find a worthy man serving under a fool, or a morally superior man in a position inferior to a wretch, as is the case in this world.

The last proposition of this belief is the existence of Paradise and Hell, which is also not impossible.
If God can make the sun, the moon, the stars and the earth, why should He not be able to make Paradise and Hell?
When He holds His Court, and pronounces just judgments, rewarding the meritorious and punishing the guilty, there must be a place where the meritorious may enjoy their reward â honour, happiness and gratification of all kinds â and another place where the condemned may feel debasement, pain and misery.

The above are the five articles of faith, which form the foundation for the superstructure of Islam.
Their gist is contained in the short sentence known as Kalimah-tayyibah.
When you declare La illaha illallah (there is no deity but Allah), you give up all false deities, and profess that you are a creature of the One God; and when you add to these words Muhammad-ur-Rasulullah (Muhammad is Allah's Messenger) you confirm and admit the Prophethood of Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him).
With the admission of his Prophethood it becomes obligatory that you should believe in the divine nature and attributes of God, in His angels, in His Revealed Books and in life after death, and earnestly follow that method of obeying God and worshipping Him which the Prophet Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has asked us to follow.
That way lies the road to success and salvation,</entry>

You will never be willing to waste your time and energy in useless and unproductive jobs.
Similarly, you will not be very eager to avoid a thing that is harmless.
And the general rule is that the deeper your conviction about the utility of a thing, the firmer will be your response to it; and the more doubtful you are about its efficacy, the more wavering will be your attitude.
After all, why does a child put his hand into fire?
Because he is not sure that fire burns.
Why does he evade study?
Because he does not fully grasp the importance and benefits of education and does not believe in what his elders try to impress on his mind.

Now think of the man who does not believe in the Day of Judgement.
Will he not consider belief in God and a life in accordance with His code of no consequence?
What value will he attach to a life in pursuit Â«f His pleasure?
To him neither obedience to God is of any advantage, nor disobedience to Him of any harm.
How, then, can it be possible for him to scrupulously follow the injunctions of God, His Prophet, and His Book?
What incentive will there be for him to undergo trials and sacrifices and to avoid worldly pleasures?
And if a man does not follow the code of God and lives according to his own likes and dislikes, of what use is his belief in the existence of God, if indeed he has any such belief?
That is not all.
If you reflect still deeper, you will come to the conclusion that belief in life after death is the most decisive factor in the life of a man.
Its acceptance or rejection determines the very course of his life and behaviour.

But a man who believes in the next world as well and is convinced of the final consequences of his acts will look on all worldly gains and losses as temporary and transitory and will not put his eternal bliss at stake for a passing gain.
He will look on things in their wider perspective and always keep the permanent benefit or harm in view.
He will do the good, however costly it may be to him in terms of worldly gains, or however injurious it may be to his immediate interests: and he will avoid the wrong, however tempting it may look.
He will judge things from the viewpoint of their eternal consequences and not according to his whims and caprices.

Thus there is a radical difference between the beliefs, approaches and lives of the two persons.
One's idea of a good act is limited to whether in this brief temporary life it will bring gain in the shape of money, property, public applause and similar other things which give him position, power, reputation and worldly happiness.
Such things become his objectives in life.
Fulfillment of his own wishes and self-aggrandizement become the be-all and end-all of his life.
And he does not draw back even from cruel and unjust means to achieve his ends.
Similarly, his conception of a wrong act is one, which may involve a risk or injury to his interests in this world such as loss of property and life, harming of health, blackening of reputation or some other unpleasant consequence.

In contrast to this man, the believer's concept of good and evil will be quite different.
To him all that pleases God is good and all that invokes His displeasure and wrath is evil.
A good act, according to him, will remain good even if it brings no benefit to him in this world, or even entails loss of some worldly possession or injury to his -personal interests.
He will be confident that God will reward him in the eternal life and will be the real success.
Similarly, he will not fall prey to evil deeds merely for some worldly gain, for he knows that even if he escapes punishment in his short worldly life, in the end he will be the loser because he will not be able to escape punishment from the court of God.
He does not believe in the relativity of morals but sticks to the absolute standards revealed by God and lives according to them irrespective of gain or injury in this world.

Islam says "In the way of God give charity (zakah) to the poor."
His answer is: "No zakah will lessen my wealth: I will, instead, take interest on my money," And in its collection he will not hesitate to take everything belonging to the debtors however poor or hungry they may be.
Islam says: "Always speak the truth and shun lying, though you may gain ever so much by lying and lose ever so much by speaking the truth."
But his reply will be "Well, what shall I do with a truth which is of no use to me here, and which instead brings loss to me; and why should I avoid lying where it can bring benefit to me without any risk, even that of a bad name?"
He visits a lonely place and finds a precious metal lying there; in such a situation Islam says: "This is not your property, do not take it," but he would say: "This is a thing I have come by without any cost or trouble; why should I not have it?
There is no one to see me pick this up, no one who might report it to the police or give evidence against me in a court of law, or give me a bad name among the people.
Why should I not make use of this valuable?"
Someone secretly keeps a deposit with this man, and eventually he dies.
Islam says: "Be honest with the property deposited with you and give it over to the heirs of the deceased."
He says: "Why?
There is no evidence of his property being with me; his children also have no knowledge of it.
When I can appropriate it without any difficulty, without any fear of legal claim, or stain on my reputation, why should I not do so?"

In short, at every step in life, Islam will direct him to walk in a certain direction and adopt a certain attitude and course of behaviour; but he will go in the opposite direction.
For Islam measures and values everything from the viewpoint of its eternal consequence; while such a person always has in view only the immediate and earthly outcome.
Now, you can understand why a man cannot be a Muslim without belief in the Day of Judgement.
To be a Muslim is d very great thing; the fact is that one cannot even become a good man without this belief, for the denial of the Day of Judgement degrades man from humanity to a place even lower than that of the lowest of animals.

Life After Death: A Rational Vindication So far we have discussed the need and importance of belief in the Day of Judgement.
Now let us consider how far the constituents of the belief are rationally understandable.
The fact is that whatever Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has told us about life after death is clearly borne out by reason.
Although our belief in that Day is based on our implicit trust in the Messenger of God, rational reflection not only confirms this belief but also reveals that Muhammad's (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) teachings in this respect are much more reasonable and understandable than any other viewpoint about life after death.

1.Some people say that there is nothing left of man after death, and that after this life-ending event there is no other life.
According to these people, belief in life after death has no reality.
They say it is scientifically impossible.
This is the view of the atheists who also claim to be scientific in their approach and bring in Western science to support their arguments.

2.Other people maintain that man, in order to bear the consequences of his deeds, is repeatedly regenerated in this world.
If he lives a bad life, he will assume in the next generation the shape of some animal, such as a dog or a cat, or some tree or some lower kind of man.
If his acts have been good, he will be reborn as a man into a higher class.
This viewpoint is found in some Eastern religions.

3.There is a third viewpoint which calls for belie!'
in the Day of Judgement, the Resurrection, man's presence in the Divine Court, and the meting out of reward and punishment.
This is the common belief of all the Prophets.

The first group, which arrogates to itself the authority and support of science, alleges that there is no life after death.
They say that they have never seen anybody coming back from the dead.
After death a man is reduced to dust; therefore, death is the end of life and there is no life after death.
But consider this reasoning: is this really a scientific argument?
Is the claim really founded on reason?
If they have not seen a single case of revival after death, they can only say that they do not know what will happen after death.
But, instead of remaining within this limit, they declare that nothing will happen after death, at the same time alleging that they speak out of knowledge!
In fact they merely generalize on ignorance.
Science tells us nothing â negative or positive â in this respect and their assertion that life after death has no existence is totally unfounded.
Their claim is not dissimilar to the claim of an ignoramus who has not seen an aeroplane and on that 'knowledge' proclaims that aeroplanes do not exist at all!
Because somebody has not seen a thing, it does not mean that that thing does not exist.
No man, not even the whole of humanity, if it has not seen a thing, can claim that such a thing does not, or car-not, exist.
This claim is out and out unscientific.
No reasonable man can give it any weight.

Now look at the beliefs of the second group.
According to them, a human being is a human being because in his previous animal form he had done good deeds; and an animal is an animal because previously as a human being he had behaved badly.
In other words, to be a man or an animal is the consequence of one's deeds in one's former form.
One may well ask "Which of them existed first, man or animal?"
If they say man preceded animal, then they will have to accept that he must have been an animal before that, and was given a human form for its good deeds.
If they say it was animal they will have to concede that there must have been before that a man who was transformed into an animal for his bad deeds.
This leads to a vicious circle; the advocates of this belief cannot settle on any form for the first creature, for every generation implies a preceding generation so that the succeeding generation may be considered as the consequence of the former.
This is simply absurd.

Now consider the third viewpoint.
Its first proposition is: that "this world will one day come to an end.
God will destroy and annihilate the universe, and in its place will evolve another higher and far superior cosmos."

This statement is undeniably true.
No doubt can be cast on it.
The more we reflect on the nature of the cosmos, the more clearly it is proved that the existing system is not permanent and everlasting: all the forces working in it are limited in their nature, and will one day be exhausted.
That is why the scientists agree that one day the sun will become cold and will give up all its energy, stars will collide with one another and the whole system of the universe will be upset and destroyed.
Moreover, if evolution is true in the case of the constituents of this universe, why may it not be true for the whole of it?
To think of the universe becoming totally non-existent is more improbable than that it will pass into another evolutionary stage, and another, much-improved order of things will emerge.

The second proposition of this belief is that "man will again be given life".
Is it impossible?
If so, how did the present life of man become possible?
It is evident that God Who created man in this world can do so in the next.
Not only is it a possibility, it is also a positive necessity, as will be shown later.

The third proposition is that "the record of all the actions of man in this world is preserved and will be presented on the Day of Resurrection".
The proof of the truth of this proposition is provided today by science itself.
The sounds, which we make, produce slight waves in the air and die out.
It has been discovered that the sound leaves its impression on its surrounding objects and can be reproduced.
Gramophone records are made on this principle.
From this it can be understood that the record of every movement of man is being impressed on everything, which comes into contact with the waves produced by the movements.
This shows that the record of all our deeds is completely preserved and can be reproduced.

The fourth proposition is that "on the Day of Resurrection.
God will hold His Court and, with just judgement, reward or punish man for his good and bad deeds".
What is unreasonable about this?
Reason itself demands that God should hold His court and pronounce judgement.
We see men doing good deeds and gaining nothing in this world.
We see other men doing bad deeds and not suffering for it.
Not only this, we see thousands of cases of good acts bringing trouble on the doer, and of bad deeds resulting in the happiness and gratification of the guilty person.
When we notice these events happening every day, our reason and sense of justice demand that a time must come when the man who does good must be rewarded and the one who does evil must be punished.
If you have a tin of petrol and a match- box, you can set fire to the house of your opponent, and apparently escape every consequence.
Does this mean that such an offence has no consequences at all?
Certainly not!
It means only that its physical outcome has appeared, and the moral outcome is hidden.
Do you really think it reasonable that it should never appear?
If you say it should, the question is, where?
Certainly not in this world, where only the physical consequences of actions manifest themselves fully, and rational and moral consequences do not become apparent.

Results and consequences of this higher category can appear only if there comes into existence another order of things wherein rational and moral laws reign supreme and occupy the governing position and where the physical laws are made subject to them.
That is the next world, which, as we have said before, is the next evolutionary stage of the universe.
It is evolutionary in the sense that it will be governed by moral rather than by physical laws.
The rational consequences of man's actions, which are hidden wholly or partly in this world, will then appear.
Man's stature will be determined by his rational and moral worth judged in accordance with his conduct in this life of test and trial.
There you will not find a worthy man serving under a fool, or a morally superior man in a position inferior to a wretch, as is the case in this world.

The last proposition of this belief is the existence of Paradise and Hell, which is also not impossible.
If God can make the sun, the moon, the stars and the earth, why should He not be able to make Paradise and Hell?
When He holds His Court, and pronounces just judgments, rewarding the meritorious and punishing the guilty, there must be a place where the meritorious may enjoy their reward â honour, happiness and gratification of all kinds â and another place where the condemned may feel debasement, pain and misery.

The above are the five articles of faith, which form the foundation for the superstructure of Islam.
Their gist is contained in the short sentence known as Kalimah-tayyibah.
When you declare La illaha illallah (there is no deity but Allah), you give up all false deities, and profess that you are a creature of the One God; and when you add to these words Muhammad-ur-Rasulullah (Muhammad is Allah's Messenger) you confirm and admit the Prophethood of Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him).
With the admission of his Prophethood it becomes obligatory that you should believe in the divine nature and attributes of God, in His angels, in His Revealed Books and in life after death, and earnestly follow that method of obeying God and worshipping Him which the Prophet Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has asked us to follow.
That way lies the road to success and salvation."</entry>
  <entry author_id="989077" end="579" start="428">Belief in Life After DeathThe fifth article of Islamic Faith is belief in life after death.
The Prophet Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has directed us to believe in resurrection after death and in the Day of Judgement.
The essential ingredients of this belief, as taught to us by him, are as follows:

That the life of this world and of all that is in it will come to an end on an appointed day.
Everything will be annihilated.
That day is called Qiyamah, i.e. the Last Day.

The Need of this Belief Belief in life after death has always been an integral part of the teachings of the Prophets.
Every Prophet asked his followers to believe in it, in the same way as the last of the Prophets, Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him), has asked us to do.
This has always been an essential condition of being a Muslim.
All Prophets have categorically declared that one who does not believe in it, or casts doubts on it, is a Kafir.
This is so because denial of life after death makes all other beliefs meaningless.
This denial also destroys the very sanction for a good life and man is driven to a life of ignorance and disbelief.
A little reflection makes this quite clear.

In your everyday life, whenever you are asked to do anything, you immediately think: what is the use of doing it and what harm is involved in not doing it?
This is in the very nature of man.
He instinctively regards a useless action as totally unnecessary.
You will never be willing to waste your time and energy in useless and unproductive jobs.

And if a man does not follow the code of God and lives according to his own likes and dislikes, of what use is his belief in the existence of God, if indeed he has any such belief?
That is not all.
If you reflect still deeper, you will come to the conclusion that belief in life after death is the most decisive factor in the life of a man.
Its acceptance or rejection determines the very course of his life and behaviour.

But a man who believes in the next world as well and is convinced of the final consequences of his acts will look on all worldly gains and losses as temporary and transitory and will not put his eternal bliss at stake for a passing gain.
He will look on things in their wider perspective and always keep the permanent benefit or harm in view.
He will do the good, however costly it may be to him in terms of worldly gains, or however injurious it may be to his immediate interests: and he will avoid the wrong, however tempting it may look.
He will judge things from the viewpoint of their eternal consequences and not according to his whims and caprices.

Thus there is a radical difference between the beliefs, approaches and lives of the two persons.
One's idea of a good act is limited to whether in this brief temporary life it will bring gain in the shape of money, property, public applause and similar other things which give him position, power, reputation and worldly happiness.
Such things become his objectives in life.
Fulfillment of his own wishes and self-aggrandizement become the be-all and end-all of his life.
And he does not draw back even from cruel and unjust means to achieve his ends.
Similarly, his conception of a wrong act is one, which may involve a risk or injury to his interests in this world such as loss of property and life, harming of health, blackening of reputation or some other unpleasant consequence.

In contrast to this man, the believer's concept of good and evil will be quite different.
To him all that pleases God is good and all that invokes His displeasure and wrath is evil.
A good act, according to him, will remain good even if it brings no benefit to him in this world, or even entails loss of some worldly possession or injury to his -personal interests.
He will be confident that God will reward him in the eternal life and will be the real success.
Similarly, he will not fall prey to evil deeds merely for some worldly gain, for he knows that even if he escapes punishment in his short worldly life, in the end he will be the loser because he will not be able to escape punishment from the court of God.
He does not believe in the relativity of morals but sticks to the absolute standards revealed by God and lives according to them irrespective of gain or injury in this world.

Islam says "In the way of God give charity (zakah) to the poor."
His answer is: "No zakah will lessen my wealth: I will, instead, take interest on my money," And in its collection he will not hesitate to take everything belonging to the debtors however poor or hungry they may be.
Islam says: "Always speak the truth and shun lying, though you may gain ever so much by lying and lose ever so much by speaking the truth."
But his reply will be "Well, what shall I do with a truth which is of no use to me here, and which instead brings loss to me; and why should I avoid lying where it can bring benefit to me without any risk, even that of a bad name?"
He visits a lonely place and finds a precious metal lying there; in such a situation Islam says: "This is not your property, do not take it," but he would say: "This is a thing I have come by without any cost or trouble; why should I not have it?
There is no one to see me pick this up, no one who might report it to the police or give evidence against me in a court of law, or give me a bad name among the people.
Why should I not make use of this valuable?"
Someone secretly keeps a deposit with this man, and eventually he dies.
Islam says: "Be honest with the property deposited with you and give it over to the heirs of the deceased."
He says: "Why?
There is no evidence of his property being with me; his children also have no knowledge of it.
When I can appropriate it without any difficulty, without any fear of legal claim, or stain on my reputation, why should I not do so?"

In short, at every step in life, Islam will direct him to walk in a certain direction and adopt a certain attitude and course of behaviour; but he will go in the opposite direction.
For Islam measures and values everything from the viewpoint of its eternal consequence; while such a person always has in view only the immediate and earthly outcome.
Now, you can understand why a man cannot be a Muslim without belief in the Day of Judgement.
To be a Muslim is d very great thing; the fact is that one cannot even become a good man without this belief, for the denial of the Day of Judgement degrades man from humanity to a place even lower than that of the lowest of animals.

Life After Death: A Rational Vindication So far we have discussed the need and importance of belief in the Day of Judgement.
Now let us consider how far the constituents of the belief are rationally understandable.
The fact is that whatever Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has told us about life after death is clearly borne out by reason.
Although our belief in that Day is based on our implicit trust in the Messenger of God, rational reflection not only confirms this belief but also reveals that Muhammad's (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) teachings in this respect are much more reasonable and understandable than any other viewpoint about life after death.

1.Some people say that there is nothing left of man after death, and that after this life-ending event there is no other life.
According to these people, belief in life after death has no reality.
They say it is scientifically impossible.
This is the view of the atheists who also claim to be scientific in their approach and bring in Western science to support their arguments.

2.Other people maintain that man, in order to bear the consequences of his deeds, is repeatedly regenerated in this world.
If he lives a bad life, he will assume in the next generation the shape of some animal, such as a dog or a cat, or some tree or some lower kind of man.
If his acts have been good, he will be reborn as a man into a higher class.
This viewpoint is found in some Eastern religions.

3.There is a third viewpoint which calls for belie!'
in the Day of Judgement, the Resurrection, man's presence in the Divine Court, and the meting out of reward and punishment.
This is the common belief of all the Prophets.

The first group, which arrogates to itself the authority and support of science, alleges that there is no life after death.
They say that they have never seen anybody coming back from the dead.
After death a man is reduced to dust; therefore, death is the end of life and there is no life after death.
But consider this reasoning: is this really a scientific argument?
Is the claim really founded on reason?
If they have not seen a single case of revival after death, they can only say that they do not know what will happen after death.
But, instead of remaining within this limit, they declare that nothing will happen after death, at the same time alleging that they speak out of knowledge!
In fact they merely generalize on ignorance.
Science tells us nothing â negative or positive â in this respect and their assertion that life after death has no existence is totally unfounded.
Their claim is not dissimilar to the claim of an ignoramus who has not seen an aeroplane and on that 'knowledge' proclaims that aeroplanes do not exist at all!
Because somebody has not seen a thing, it does not mean that that thing does not exist.
No man, not even the whole of humanity, if it has not seen a thing, can claim that such a thing does not, or car-not, exist.
This claim is out and out unscientific.
No reasonable man can give it any weight.

Now look at the beliefs of the second group.
According to them, a human being is a human being because in his previous animal form he had done good deeds; and an animal is an animal because previously as a human being he had behaved badly.
In other words, to be a man or an animal is the consequence of one's deeds in one's former form.
One may well ask "Which of them existed first, man or animal?"
If they say man preceded animal, then they will have to accept that he must have been an animal before that, and was given a human form for its good deeds.
If they say it was animal they will have to concede that there must have been before that a man who was transformed into an animal for his bad deeds.
This leads to a vicious circle; the advocates of this belief cannot settle on any form for the first creature, for every generation implies a preceding generation so that the succeeding generation may be considered as the consequence of the former.
This is simply absurd.

Now consider the third viewpoint.
Its first proposition is: that "this world will one day come to an end.
God will destroy and annihilate the universe, and in its place will evolve another higher and far superior cosmos."

This statement is undeniably true.
No doubt can be cast on it.
The more we reflect on the nature of the cosmos, the more clearly it is proved that the existing system is not permanent and everlasting: all the forces working in it are limited in their nature, and will one day be exhausted.
That is why the scientists agree that one day the sun will become cold and will give up all its energy, stars will collide with one another and the whole system of the universe will be upset and destroyed.
Moreover, if evolution is true in the case of the constituents of this universe, why may it not be true for the whole of it?
To think of the universe becoming totally non-existent is more improbable than that it will pass into another evolutionary stage, and another, much-improved order of things will emerge.

The second proposition of this belief is that "man will again be given life".
Is it impossible?
If so, how did the present life of man become possible?
It is evident that God Who created man in this world can do so in the next.
Not only is it a possibility, it is also a positive necessity, as will be shown later.

The third proposition is that "the record of all the actions of man in this world is preserved and will be presented on the Day of Resurrection".
The proof of the truth of this proposition is provided today by science itself.
The sounds, which we make, produce slight waves in the air and die out.
It has been discovered that the sound leaves its impression on its surrounding objects and can be reproduced.
Gramophone records are made on this principle.
From this it can be understood that the record of every movement of man is being impressed on everything, which comes into contact with the waves produced by the movements.
This shows that the record of all our deeds is completely preserved and can be reproduced.

The fourth proposition is that "on the Day of Resurrection.
God will hold His Court and, with just judgement, reward or punish man for his good and bad deeds".
What is unreasonable about this?
Reason itself demands that God should hold His court and pronounce judgement.
We see men doing good deeds and gaining nothing in this world.
We see other men doing bad deeds and not suffering for it.
Not only this, we see thousands of cases of good acts bringing trouble on the doer, and of bad deeds resulting in the happiness and gratification of the guilty person.
When we notice these events happening every day, our reason and sense of justice demand that a time must come when the man who does good must be rewarded and the one who does evil must be punished.
If you have a tin of petrol and a match- box, you can set fire to the house of your opponent, and apparently escape every consequence.
Does this mean that such an offence has no consequences at all?
Certainly not!
It means only that its physical outcome has appeared, and the moral outcome is hidden.
Do you really think it reasonable that it should never appear?
If you say it should, the question is, where?
Certainly not in this world, where only the physical consequences of actions manifest themselves fully, and rational and moral consequences do not become apparent.

Results and consequences of this higher category can appear only if there comes into existence another order of things wherein rational and moral laws reign supreme and occupy the governing position and where the physical laws are made subject to them.
That is the next world, which, as we have said before, is the next evolutionary stage of the universe.
It is evolutionary in the sense that it will be governed by moral rather than by physical laws.
The rational consequences of man's actions, which are hidden wholly or partly in this world, will then appear.
Man's stature will be determined by his rational and moral worth judged in accordance with his conduct in this life of test and trial.
There you will not find a worthy man serving under a fool, or a morally superior man in a position inferior to a wretch, as is the case in this world.

The last proposition of this belief is the existence of Paradise and Hell, which is also not impossible.
If God can make the sun, the moon, the stars and the earth, why should He not be able to make Paradise and Hell?
When He holds His Court, and pronounces just judgments, rewarding the meritorious and punishing the guilty, there must be a place where the meritorious may enjoy their reward â honour, happiness and gratification of all kinds â and another place where the condemned may feel debasement, pain and misery.

The above are the five articles of faith, which form the foundation for the superstructure of Islam.
Their gist is contained in the short sentence known as Kalimah-tayyibah.
When you declare La illaha illallah (there is no deity but Allah), you give up all false deities, and profess that you are a creature of the One God; and when you add to these words Muhammad-ur-Rasulullah (Muhammad is Allah's Messenger) you confirm and admit the Prophethood of Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him).
With the admission of his Prophethood it becomes obligatory that you should believe in the divine nature and attributes of God, in His angels, in His Revealed Books and in life after death, and earnestly follow that method of obeying God and worshipping Him which the Prophet Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has asked us to follow.</entry>
  <entry author_id="7479741" end="756" start="730">When dealing with afterlife/eternal life Scripture has to take into account three distinct periods (1) from the fall of Adam to the coming of Christ (2) the Kingdom of God the Son from the coming of Christ to the Last Day (3) the Kingdom of God the Father after the Last Day.
You will need to know this to understand the following passages of Scripture.
The Resurrection, dealing with period (1) above: "Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection; â¦â¦.
But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
He is not God of the dead, but of the living" (Matthew Ch 22).
Note: Angels often appeared in human form.
They even ate food which Abraham prepared for them.
"Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you."
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.
Do you believe this?"
She said to him, "Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world."'
(John Ch 11) Note that Jesus did not agree with Martha when she linked the resurrection to the Last Day.
Timing of the resurrection: "Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will liveâ¦â¦for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgement."
(John Ch 5) "And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split; the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many."
(Matthew Ch 27)  The Last Day, dealing with periods (2) and (3) above: "All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out.
For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me; and this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day."
(John Ch 6) "The kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; when it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad.
So it will be at the close of the age.
The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous, and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
He who has ears, let him hear" (Matthew Ch 13).</entry>

As doing the same for the second time is naturally easier than the first time.
Although neither the first nor the second creation is difficult for Him.

5-Afterlife is the natural demand of our morality as we know that good and bad are not equal and same and they shouldn't be.
Should the reward of prophets and pious people (who are the best people of humanity) and the worst people be the same.
Should human beings and trees or insects be dealt equally that both die and that is all?

And man (the disbeliever) says: "What!
When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?"
Doesn't he remember that We created him before, when he was nothing

Does not man see that We created him from a mere sperm-drop?
Yet behold!

And he makes comparisons for Us and forgets his own creation.
He says: "Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust?"

And He is the All-knower of every creation!"
He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold, you kindle from it.
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth, Able to create the like of them?
Yes, indeed!
He is the All-Knowing Supreme Creator.

And now concerning thy question regarding the soul of man and its survival after death.
Know thou of a truth that the soul, after its separation from the body, will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of God, in a state and condition which neither the revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes and chances of this world, can alter.
It will endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His dominion and power will endure.
It will manifest the signs of God and His attributes, and will reveal His loving kindness and bounty.
The movement of My Pen is stilled when it attempteth to befittingly describe the loftiness and glory of so exalted a station.
The honor with which the Hand of Mercy will invest the soul is such as no tongue can adequately reveal, nor any other earthly agency describe.
Blessed is the soul which, at the hour of its separation from the body, is sanctified from the vain imaginings of the peoples of the world.
Such a soul liveth and moveth in accordance with the Will of its Creator, and entereth the all-highest Paradise.
The Maids of Heaven, inmates of the loftiest mansions, will circle around it, and the Prophets of God and His chosen ones will seek its companionship.
With them that soul will freely converse, and will recount unto them that which it hath been made to endure in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds.
If any man be told that which hath been ordained for such a soul in the worlds of God, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, his whole being will instantly blaze out in his great longing to attain that most exalted, that sanctified and resplendent station....
The nature of the soul after death can never be described, nor is it meet and permissible to reveal its whole character to the eyes of men.
The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth.
The purpose underlying Their revelation hath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the Most High.
The light which these souls radiate is responsible for the progress of the world and the advancement of its peoples.
They are like unto leaven which leaveneth the world of being, and constitute the animating force through which the arts and wonders of the world are made manifest.
Through them the clouds rain their bounty upon men, and the earth bringeth forth its fruits.
All things must needs have a cause, a motive power, an animating principle.
These souls and symbols of detachment have provided, and will continue to provide, the supreme moving impulse in the world of being.
The world beyond is as different from this world as this world is different from that of the child while still in the womb of its mother.
When the soul attaineth the Presence of God, it will assume the form that best befitteth its immortality and is worthy of its celestial habitation.
Such an existence is a contingent and not an absolute existence, inasmuch as the former is preceded by a cause, whilst the latter is independent thereof.
Absolute existence is strictly confined to God, exalted be His glory.
Well is it with them that apprehend this truth.

If any man be told that which hath been ordained for such a soul in the worlds of God, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, his whole being will instantly blaze out in his great longing to attain that most exalted, that sanctified and resplendent station....
The nature of the soul after death can never be described, nor is it meet and permissible to reveal its whole character to the eyes of men.
The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth.
The purpose underlying Their revelation hath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the Most High.
The light which these souls radiate is responsible for the progress of the world and the advancement of its peoples.
They are like unto leaven which leaveneth the world of being, and constitute the animating force through which the arts and wonders of the world are made manifest.
Through them the clouds rain their bounty upon men, and the earth bringeth forth its fruits.
All things must needs have a cause, a motive power, an animating principle.
These souls and symbols of detachment have provided, and will continue to provide, the supreme moving impulse in the world of being.
The world beyond is as different from this world as this world is different from that of the child while still in the womb of its mother.
When the soul attaineth the Presence of God, it will assume the form that best befitteth its immortality and is worthy of its celestial habitation.
Such an existence is a contingent and not an absolute existence, inasmuch as the former is preceded by a cause, whilst the latter is independent thereof.
Absolute existence is strictly confined to God, exalted be His glory.
Well is it with them that apprehend this truth.
Wert thou to ponder in thine heart the behavior of the Prophets of God thou wouldst assuredly and readily testify that there must needs be other worlds besides this world.
The majority of the truly wise and learned have, throughout the ages, as it hath been recorded by the Pen of Glory in the Tablet of Wisdom, borne witness to the truth of that which the holy Writ of God hath revealed.
Even the materialists have testified in their writings to the wisdom of these divinely-appointed Messengers, and have regarded the references made by the Prophets to Paradise, to hell fire, to future reward and punishment, to have been actuated by a desire to educate and uplift the souls of men.
Consider, therefore, how the generality of mankind, whatever their beliefs or theories, have recognized the excellence, and admitted the superiority, of these Prophets of God.
These Gems of Detachment are acclaimed by some as the embodiments of wisdom, while others believe them to be the mouthpiece of God Himself.
How could such Souls have consented to surrender themselves unto their enemies if they believed all the worlds of God to have been reduced to this earthly life?
Would they have willingly suffered such afflictions and torments as no man hath ever experienced or witnessed?</entry>

He called the holy souls among those who have passed on the Concourse on High and said that the highest paradise, which He called AbhÃ¡ Kingdom, is a symbol for nearness to such holy souls and the Prophets of God (see: BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith and the unity of religions) and Maids of Heaven.
In better and more detailed language in His own Words:

And now concerning thy question regarding the soul of man and its survival after death.
Know thou of a truth that the soul, after its separation from the body, will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of God, in a state and condition which neither the revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes and chances of this world, can alter.
It will endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His dominion and power will endure.
It will manifest the signs of God and His attributes, and will reveal His loving kindness and bounty.
The movement of My Pen is stilled when it attempteth to befittingly describe the loftiness and glory of so exalted a station.
The honor with which the Hand of Mercy will invest the soul is such as no tongue can adequately reveal, nor any other earthly agency describe.
Blessed is the soul which, at the hour of its separation from the body, is sanctified from the vain imaginings of the peoples of the world.
Such a soul liveth and moveth in accordance with the Will of its Creator, and entereth the all-highest Paradise.
The Maids of Heaven, inmates of the loftiest mansions, will circle around it, and the Prophets of God and His chosen ones will seek its companionship.
With them that soul will freely converse, and will recount unto them that which it hath been made to endure in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds.

  <entry author_id="7937280" end="983" start="970">Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings, according to rabbis such as Rabbi Avraham Arieh Trugman, "Reincarnation is part and parcel of Jewish tradition."
Rabbi Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories are known.
"The classic work of Jewish mysticism is the Zohar," he continues, "which has its source from 2000 years ago... And in the Zohar, which is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning, the idea of reincarnation is mentioned over and over again."
He states that, "In the last 500 years the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure."

According to Rabbi Shraga Simmons, "In the Bible itself, the idea reincarnationis intimated in Deut.
25:5-10, Deut.
33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6."

Rabbi Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote, "Surprise!
Reincarnation is an ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism.
The Zohar, written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai close to two thousand years ago, speaks frequently and at length about reincarnation.
Onkelos, a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, "Let Reuben live and not dieâ¦" (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as result of being reincarnated.
The great Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, Nachmanides (Ramban 1195-1270), attributed Jobâs suffering to reincarnation as hinted in Jobâs saying "G-d does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit toâ¦the light of the living" (Job 33:29,30)."</entry>
  <entry author_id="14443975" end="1002" start="983">Flaw in interpretation of Vedas: There is a basic flaw in the way we interpret the Vedas.
We try to understand Vedic hymns by knowing just their literal meaning.
We never try to understand the symbolism used in the hymn.
Let's consider Rigveda - 1.10.14-8 'O Spirit of the dead!
Go to the highest heaven and meet with Yama and your ancestors.
Carry with you only the good Karmas, leaving behind the bad.
Seek a body and a new home (reincarnate) and a life of glory.

Symbolism in the hymn: Here 'death' refers to abolition of an over efficient activity due to safety mechanisms.
Yama is the god of compulsion and gives us control over uncontrollable activitities.
'Ancestors' means failed attempts that resulted in abolition of the activity.
To execute the activity successfully, we must just consider occasions on which the activity was almost successful (good Karma) and ignore attempts in which the activity failed miserably (bad Karma).
If we keep both near successes and disasters in mind, the result of the next attempt would be unpredictable.
It is this unexpected transformation of the activity which we call Reincarnation.

Reincarnation, according to Brahmajnana, is the unexpected transformation of an activity every time it is repeated.
This makes the activity inefficient and unreliable.
The force that causes this transformation is what we call Karma.
Eradication of Karma would thus abolish Reincarnation.
Thus, according to Brahmajnana, Reincarnation has nothing to do with our previous or next birth.
For the same reason, according to Brahmajnana we can attain Moksha in this life only.</entry>
