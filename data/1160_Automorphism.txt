In mathematics, an automorphism is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself.
It is, in some sense, a symmetry of the object, a way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure.
The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group, called the automorphism group.
It is, loosely speaking, the symmetry group of the object.
The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of "mathematical object" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an "isomorphism" of that object.
The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called category theory.
Category theory deals with abstract objects and morphisms between those objects.

In the context of abstract algebra, for example, a mathematical object is an algebraic structure such as a group, ring, or vector space.
An isomorphism is simply a bijective homomorphism.
(Of course, the definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example: group homomorphism, ring homomorphism, and linear operator).
The set of automorphisms of an object X form a group under composition of morphisms.
This group is called the automorphism group of X.
That this is indeed a group is simple to see:The automorphism group of an object X in a category C is denoted Aut(X), or simply Aut(X) if the category is clear from context.
In some categories—notably groups, rings, and Lie algebras—it is possible to seperate automorphisms into two classes:The former corresponding to automorphisms coming from "conjugation" by elements of the object itself, and the latter being everything else.

In group theory, for example, let a be an element of a group G. Conjugation by a is the group homomorphism φ: G → G given by φ(g) = aga.
One can easily check that conjugation by a is actually a group automorphism.
An inner automorphism is then an automorphism corresponding to conjugation by some element a.
