The central question in the abortion debate is a clash of presumed or perceived rights.
Is a fetus, sometimes called the 'unborn' by 'Pro-Life' or anti-abortion advocates, a human being with a right to life, and if so, at what point in the pregnancy does the fetus become human?
Do women have a right to control their own bodies?
How does one balance these respective rights, or do they both exist?
The 'Pro-Life' argument is for the most parts straight-forward; a fetus becomes human at the moment of conception.
Therefore, in their eyes, the issue is, as their name suggests, about the right to life of a pre-birth human being.
It follows from that if the fetus is human, the right of a woman to control her own body cannot outweigh the greater right to life of her unborn child.
'Pro-Choice' advocates hold a fundamentally different proposition.
That a fetus is not a human being at the moment of conception, but much later in the pregnancy, when the fetus develops sufficiently to be viable on its own.
Therefore the central issue is the woman's right to be able to control her own body, a superior right to the rights of a non-human fetus which further on will achieve a human status.

Some critics question why both sides fail to agree on a compromise, but that may be to mis-understand that both sides hold mutually incompatable beliefs.
If they believe a fetus is human with a fundamental right to life, 'Pro-Life' advocates cannot logically accept the compromise that accepts a right to terminate that life.
Equally, if 'Pro-Choice' advocates believe that a fetus is not a human being until later in the pregnancy, their argument that abortion is about a woman's right to choose whether or not to be pregnant is a fundamental principle; thus to limit the right to abortion is to undermine the entire principle of a woman's control of her own body.

These absolute principles make achieving a compromise difficult, with both sides believing in absolute terms that the 'right' they are defending is a fundamental one.
Fundamentally difference perspectives on pregnancy and which right is superior in turn produces fundamentalist stances and use of language.
Pope John Paul II, a leading critic of abortion, on the basis of his belief that abortion involves the deliberate killing of a human being, has compared the millions of deaths from abortion to the Holocaust.
Pro-Choice campaigners accuse their opponents of an 'anti-woman agenda', with women 'trapped' in 'unwanted pregnancies' from which they have a fundamental right and medical means to escape.
However the reality is often more complicated than the straight-forward advocates on each side sometimes admit.

These definitions flow naturally from the fundamental principles and perspectives on the issue held by both.
The differing analyses impacts on each other's criticism of the other side and the language used to define them.
If one believes a fetus is a pre-birth human, with a right to life, then it is understandable if some on the 'Pro-Life' side accuse the 'Pro-Choice' side of being 'anti-life' and 'pro-abortion', a viewpoint the 'Pro-Choice lobby rejects and takes offence at.
Equally, if one subscribes to the belief on the Pro-Choice side that the fetus isn't human.
and that the central issue is simply a woman's right to choose, it is logical to perceive the 'Pro-Life' side as simply 'anti-choice'.
But this too is rejected by the 'Pro-Life' side, who argue that they aren't against any legitimate choice; in their eyes choosing to terminate the right to life of a pre-birth human is not a legitimate choice, but facilitating something which if carried out on a post-birth human would be regarded as homocide or murder.

Contrary to presumptions, abortion is not legal throughout the United Kingdom.
It remains illegal in Northern Ireland.
Efforts by some British politicians to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland have been frustrated by overwhelming opposition from both communities, from the Roman Catholic Church on the nationalist side to the Rev.
Ian Paisley, the leader of the protestant Democratic Unionist Party, on the unionist side.
Even the cross-community Women's Coalition has declined to support a change in the law on abortion in Northern Ireland.

In essence, if one believes that a human being has a right to life (as the US Constitution and many other nations guarantee), then the abortion debate boils down to one simple question.
Is the unborn baby a human, or is it some other form of life?
From the perspective of the United States, the Declaration of Independence states "We hold these truths to be self-evident... that all men... are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
That among these rights are life... That in order to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men."
From that excerpt, we see that the document that formed the foundation for the United States (preceding even the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution), guarantees all men (human beings) the right to life, AND that in order to secure that right, governments are instituted among men.
This means that if in fact the unborn baby is found to be a human being, the United States government must in fact defend that human's right to life by making abortion illegal and prosecuting those who kill that human being, except in the very very rare case to protect the life of the mother, when both mother and baby would otherwise die.
If the unborn baby is found to not be a human being, then abortion must be legal in the United States because the government has no authority to regulate it (no human being's rights are being violated if it is found to be non-human).

Recognizing this, scientific debate has gone on from both sides of the argument.
With the debate over evolution raging for years, people had originally believed that the fetus underwent an evolutionary change from a simple organism into a human being over the 9 months it was in the womb.
This was disproven early in the debate, but not until Roe v Wade legalized abortion in the United States.
As far back as the 1970's, groups of secular (non-Christian) scientists gathered to determine whether or not the unborn baby is a human being.
Their conclusion, by a 95% majority, stated that "We can find no point between fertilization and birth that the fetus changes status from a non-human into a human simply is a human being from fertilization."
