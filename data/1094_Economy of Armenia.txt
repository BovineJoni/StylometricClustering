Armenia is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics.
It is a landlocked country between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, bordered on the north and east by Georgia and Azerbaijan and on the south and west by Iran and Turkey.
Up until independence, Armenia's economy was based largely on industry--chemicals, electronic products, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber, and textiles--and highly dependent on outside resources.
Agriculture accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold, and lead.
The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant) from Russia; the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric.
Small amounts of coal, gas, and petroleum have not yet been developed.

Like other New Independent States, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns.
Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function.
In addition, the effects of the 1988 earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.
Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved.
The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials.
Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable.
In 1992-93, GDP fell nearly 60% from its 1989 level.
The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.

Nevertheless, the Government of Armenia, helped by the cease-fire that has been in effect in Nagorno-Karabakh since 1994, has been able to carry out wideranging economic reforms which paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth.
Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years.
New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors such as agriculture in the economy.

This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions.
The IMF, World Bank, EBRD, as well as other IFIs and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans.
Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed $800 million.
These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the earthquake zone.

Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improve the investment climate, and accelerate the privatization process.
A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a Law on Privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization.
The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization.

The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization.
Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy.
Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era.
The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology.
The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration.
Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small.
The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.
By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99.
Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring, and foreign direct investment.
Armenia is trying to address its environmental problems.
It has established a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal, with the resulting revenues used for environmental protection activities.
Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a group of 12 former Soviet republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues.
The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as soon as alternate energy sources can be identified.
GDP: purchasing power parity - $11.79 billion (2003 est.)

Armenia has no proven oil reserves.
Most of its oil demands are met through imports from Russia.
Armenian oil demand is constrained, in large part, due to an economic embargo maintained by Azerbaijan to the East, and Turkey to the West.
The embargo began shortly after the secession of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan in 1988, and has held, despite a cease fire declared in 1994.
Natural gas represents a large portion of total energy consumption in Armenia, accounting for 50%.
Armenia does not produce significant quantities of natural gas, making it heavily dependent on imports to keep its economy running.
Despite a lack of fossil fuel, Armenia has significant domestic electricity generation resources.
In 2002, non-thermal domestic electricity generation accounted for 56% of total generation: 32% nuclear and 26% hydroelectric.

Armenia has a total of 11 power stations and 17 220 kV substations.
A map of Armenia's National Electricity Transmission Grid can be found at the website of the Global Energy Network Institute here.
Armenia has three thermal power plants (one in each of the following cities: Vanadzor, Hrazdan, and Yerevan) which together account for 44% of Armenia's domestic electricity generation.
Armenia has 9 hydroelectric power plants which together account for 26% of its domestic electricity generation.
The plants are grouped along two cascades:Armenia has one nuclear power plant, the controversial Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, which provides about 32% of the country's domestic electricity generation.
Nuclear fuel must be flown in from Russia and then taken along a dirt road from Yerevan because Armenia's border with Turkey is closed.
