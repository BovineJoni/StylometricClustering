Aluminium (American English; aluminum) is chemical element in the periodic table with the symbol Al and atomic number 13.
A silvery, ductile metallic true metal, aluminium is found primarily in bauxite and is remarkable for its resistance to oxidation, strength, and for its lightness.
Aluminium is used in many different industries to make millions of different products and is very important to the world economy.
The structural components that are made from this metal are vital to the aerospace industry and very important in others areas of transportation and building where light-weight, durability and strength are needed.
It is a soft lightweight strong metal with a dull silver-gray appearance, caused by a thin layer of oxidation that forms quickly when it is exposed to air and that prevents further corrosion.
Aluminium weighs about one-third as much as steel or copper; is malleable, ductile, and easily machined and cast; and has excellent corrosion resistance and durability.
It is also nonmagnetic, nonsparking, is the second most malleable metal and the sixth most ductile.
Measured either in quantity or value, aluminium's use exceeds that of any other metal except iron, and it is important in virtually all segments of the world economy.
Pure aluminium is soft and weak, but it can form alloys with small amounts of copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, and other elements to make a variety of useful properties.

These alloys form vital components of aircraft and rockets.
When aluminium is evaporated in a vacuum it forms a very reflective coating to both visible light and radiant heat.
These coatings form a thin layer of protective aluminium oxide that does not deteriorate like silver coatings do.
Coating telescope mirrors is another use of this metal.

Some of the many uses for aluminium are in; Aluminium oxidizes very energetically, and as a result has found use in solid rocket fuel and thermite.
Friedrich Wohler is generally credited with isolating aluminium (Latin alumen, alum) in 1827.
However, this metal was produced for the first time in impure form two years earlier by Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted.

Ancient Greeks and Romans used this metal as dyeing mordant and as an astringent to bind wounds.
In 1761 Guyton de Morveau proposed calling the base alum alumine.
Although it is an abundant element in the Earth's crust (8.1%), second only to silicon, it is very rare in its free form, and was once considered a precious metal more valuable than gold.
It is therefore a comparatively new industrial metal that has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years.

Recovery of this metal from scrap (via recycling) has become an important component of the aluminium industry.
A common practice since the early 1900s, aluminium recycling is not new.
It was, however, a low-profile activity until the late 1960s when recycling of aluminium beverage cans finally vaulted recycling into the public consciousness.
Sources for recycled aluminium includes automobiles, windows and doors, appliances, and other products.

Instead it is extracted through the process of electrolysis - the metal is oxidized in a solution and then reduced again as a pure metal.
Instead the Bauxite for many years was dissolved in molten cryolite, which lowers the melting point significantly to about 900°C.
But now has been replaced by an artificial mixture of aluminium, sodium, and calcium fluorides.
This process still requires lots of energy and usually aluminium plants have their own power stations nearby.

The reaction at the negative cathode is:  Here the aluminium is being reduced - the addition of electrons.

The positive anode oxidizes the oxygen from Bauxite, and then it reacts with the carbon electrode to carbon dioxide:  This cathode needs to be replaced often due to it turning in to carbon dioxide.
Aluminium can now be extracted from clay, but this process is not economical.
aluminium has nine isotopes whose mass numbers range from 23 to 30.
Only Al-27 (stable isotope) and Al-26 (radioactive isotope; t = 0.72 x 10 y) occur naturally.
Al-26 is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic-ray protons.
aluminium isotopes have found practical applications in dating marine sediments, manganese-nodules, glacial ice, quartz in rock exposures, and the terrestrial age of meteorites.
The ratio of Al-26 to beryllium-10 has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, sediment storage and burial times, and erosion on 105 to 106 year timescales.

Cosmogenic Al-26 were first applied in studies of the Moon and meteorites.
Meteorite fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial Al-26 production.

The invention of the Hall-Héroult process in 1886 made extracting aluminum from minerals inexpensive, and so it is now in common use throughout the world.

Ancient Greeks and Romans used this metal as dyeing mordant and as an astringent to bind wounds, and alum is still used as a styptic.

Aluminum is a reactive metal and cannot be extracted from its ore, bauxite (AlO), through reduction with carbon.
Instead it is extracted through the process of electrolysis -- the metal is oxidized in a solution and then reduced again as a pure metal.
The ore must be in a liquid state for this to be achieved.
However, bauxite has a melting point of 2000°C, which would be too high a temperature to heat it to economically.
Instead, the bauxite for many years was dissolved in molten cryolite, which lowers the melting point significantly to about 900°C.
But now cryolite has been replaced by an artificial mixture of aluminum, sodium, and calcium fluorides.
This process still requires a great deal of energy, and usually aluminum plants have their own power stations nearby.

The electrodes in the electrolysis of bauxite are both carbon.
Once the ore is in molten state, its ions are free to move around.
The reaction at the negative cathode is: Here the aluminum is being reduced -- the addition of electrons.
The aluminum then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off.

The positive anode oxidizes the oxygen from bauxite, and then it reacts with the carbon electrode to carbon dioxide: This cathode must be replaced often because it turns into carbon dioxide.
Despite the cost of electrolysis, aluminum is a cheap and widely used metal.

Meteorite fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial Al-26 production.
After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding protects meteorite fragments from further Al-26 production, and its decay can then be used to determine a terrestrial age.
Aluminum is one of the few abundant elements that appears to have no beneficial function at all in living cells, but a small percentage of the human population is allergic to it -- they experience contact dermatitis from any form of it: a rash from using styptic or antiperspirant products, digestive disorders and inability to absorb nutrients from food cooked in aluminum pans, and vomiting and other symptoms of poisoning from ingesting such products as Kaopectate, Amphojel, and Maalox.
In other persons, aluminum is not considered as toxic as heavy metals, but there is evidence of some toxicity if consumed in excessive amounts, although the use of aluminum cookware, popular because of its corrosion resistance and good heat conduction, has not been shown to lead to aluminum toxicity in general.
Excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminum compounds and excessive use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants are more likely causes of toxicity.
It has been suggested that aluminum may be linked to Alzheimer's disease, although that research has recently been refuted.
The official IUPAC spelling of the element is aluminium; however, Americans and Canadians generally spell and pronounce it aluminum.
In 1807, Humphrey Davy proposed aluminum for the name of this then undiscovered metal but he later decided to change the name to aluminium in order to conform with the "ium" convention used in most elements.
The aluminium spelling then became the most common in both the Britain and the United States.
Then the United States changed over time to aluminum for popular purposes.
The official name used in the United States for chemistry remained aluminium until 1926 when the American Chemical Society decided to use the name aluminum in its publications.

In 1990 IUPAC adopted aluminium as the international standard name for the element.
Aluminium is also the name used in French, Dutch, German, and Swedish; while Italian uses alluminio, Portuguese uses alumínio and Spanish uses aluminio.
(The use of these words in these other languages is one of the reasons IUPAC chose aluminium over aluminum.)
In 1993, IUPAC recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant, but still prefers the use of aluminum.

In 1993, IUPAC recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant, but still prefers the use of aluminum.

Improper use of aluminium can result in problems, particularly in contrast to iron or steel, which appear "better behaved" to the intuitive designer, mechanic, or technician.
The reduction by two thirds of the weight of an aluminium part compared to a similarly sized iron or steel part seems enormously attractive, but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a reduction by two thirds in the stiffness of the part.
Therefore, although direct replacement of an iron or steel part with a duplicate made from aluminium may still give acceptable strength to withstand peak loads, the increased flexibility will cause three times as much flex in the part.
Repeated cycling of this flex may lead to fatigue and sudden failure under loads much lower than the theoretical limit of the aluminium part.

What makes this dangerous is that aluminium does not exhibit the type of toughening under stress shown by iron, as seen when a paper clip, for instance, is repeatedly bent in an attempt to break it.
Instead, under repeated cyclic overloading and flex, aluminium will break suddenly and without the type of early evidence of impending failure exhibited by iron or steel under similar cyclic flexing; therefore care must be taken to avoid such overstress in applications where such sudden failure would be catastrophic.
For instance, the common aluminium bicycle handlebar stems are universally marked with a minimum depth of insertion of the bottom of the stem into the bicycle fork; raising the stem above this limit will result in excessive (although unnoticeable to the rider) flex in the stem and greatly increase the chance of sudden failure, resulting in total loss of steering control with potentially fatal results.

Aluminium can best be used by redesigning the part to suit its characteristics; for instance making a bicycle of aluminium tubing which has an oversize diameter rather than thicker walls.
In this way, rigidity can be restored or even enhanced without increasing weight.
The limit to this process is the increase in susceptibility to what is termed "crippling" failure, where the deviation of the force from any direction other than directly along the axis of the tubing causes folding of the walls of the tubing.
For instance, a common aluminium soft drink can should be able to support an enormous weight directly along its axis; in practice, however, the walls of the can buckle, crumple, and/or fold up under even a mild force, due to minute deviations from the precise axial direction, making possible the common pastime of flattening an empty can by slamming it against one's forehead.

The latest models of the Corvette automobile, among others, are a good example of redesigning parts to make best use of aluminium's advantages.
The aluminium chassis members and suspension parts of these cars have large overall dimensions for stiffness but are lightened by reducing cross-sectional area and removing unneeded metal; as a result, they are not only equally or more durable and stiff as the usual steel parts, but they possess an airy gracefulness which most people find attractive.
Similarly, aluminium bicycle frames can be optimally designed so as to provide rigidity where required, yet have flexibility in terms of absorbing the shock of bumps from the road and not transmitting them to the rider.

Similarly, use of aluminium in automotive applications, particularly in engine parts which must survive in difficult conditions, has benefited from development over time.
An Audi engineer commented about the V12 engine, producing over 500 horsepower, of an Auto Union race car of the 1930s which was recently restored by the Audi factory, that the aluminium alloy of which the engine was constructed would today be used only for lawn furniture and the like.
Even the aluminium cylinder heads and crankcase of the Corvair, built as recently as the 1960s, earned a reputation for failure and stripping of threads in holes, even as large as spark plug holes, which is not seen in current aluminium cylinder heads.

Often, aluminium's sensitivity to heat must also be considered.
Even a relatively routine procedure such as welding is complicated by the fact that aluminium will melt long before it gets even dully red hot; therefore, unlike steel or iron, where the experienced welder can know from the color how close the metal is to the melting point, welding aluminium requires a degree of expertise incorporating an almost intuitive sense of the metal's temperature, or else the part suddenly and without warning melts into a puddle.
Aluminium also will accumulate internal stresses and strains under conditions of overheating; while not immediately obvious, the tendency of the metal to "creep" under sustained stresses results in delayed distortions, for instance the commonly observed warping or cracking of aluminium automobile cylinder heads after an engine is overheated, sometimes as long as years later, or the tendency of welded aluminium bicycle frames to gradually twist out of alignment from thje stresses accumulated during the welding process.
For this reason, many uses of aluminium in the aerospace industry avoid heat altogether by joining parts using adhesives; this was also used for some of the early aluminium bicycle frames in the 1970s, with unfortunate results when the aluminium tubing corroded slightly, loosening the bond of the adhesive and leading to failure of the frame.
Stresses from overheating aluminium can be relieved by heat-treating the parts in an oven and gradually cooling, in effect annealing the stresses; this can also result, however, in the part becoming distorted as a result of these stresses, so that such heat-treating of welded bicycle frames, for instance, results in a significant fraction becoming misaligned.
If the misalignment is not too severe, once cooled they can be bent back into alignment with no negative consequences; of course, if the frame is properly designed for rigidity (see above), this will require enormous force.
Because of its conductivity and relatively low price compared to copper at the time, aluminium was used for household electrical wiring to a large degree in the United States in the 1970s.
Unfortunately, many of the wiring fixtures used with aluminium wiring at the time did not take into account specific differences of aluminium from copper; i.e. the greater coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminium, causing the wire to expand and contract where it was captured under the head of a screw connection, eventually working a degree of looseness into the connection; the tendency of aluminium to "creep" under steady sustained pressure (to a greater degree as the temperature rises), again producing a degree of looseness in an initially tight connection; and the tendency of the metallic aluminium contacting the connection to corrode quickly when exposed to air, which will increase the resistance in such a loosened connection.
In combination, these properties resulted in a tendency of the connections between electrical fixtures and aluminium wiring to overheat to the point where the material of the walls would ignite, and many fires occurred.
As a result, aluminium household wiring has become unpopular, and in many jurisdictions is not permitted in new construction.
However, existing aluminium wiring can be safely used with fixtures whose connections are designed to avoid this loosening/overheating runaway cycle; older fixtures of this type are marked "Al/Cu", while newer ones are marked "CO/ALR".
Otherwise, aluminium wiring can be terminated by crimping it to a short "pigtail" of copper wire, which can be treated as any other copper wire; a properly done crimp, requiring the high pressure produced by the proper tool, is tight enough not only to eliminate any thermal expansion of the aluminium, but also to exclude any atmospheric oxygen and thus prevent corrosion.
