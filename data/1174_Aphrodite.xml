She asked Eros to use his golden arrows to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest man on earth.
Eros agreed but then fell in love with Psyche on his own, or by accidentally pricking himself with a golden arrow.
Meanwhile, Psyche's parents were anxious that their daughter remained unmarried.
They consulted an oracle who told them she was destined for no mortal lover, but a monster who lived on top of a particular mountain.
Psyche was resigned to her fate and climbed to the top of the mountain.
There, Zephyrus, the west wind, gently floated her downwards.
She entered a cave on the appointed mountain, surprised to find it full of jewelry and finery.
Eros visited her every night in the cave and they made love; he demanded only that she never light any lamps because he did not want her to know who he was (having wings made him distinctive).
Her two sisters, jealous of Psyche, convinced her to do so one night and she lit a lamp, recognizing him instantly.
A drop of hot lamp oil fell on Eros' chest and he awoke, then fled.

Psyche searched for her lover across much of Greece, finally stumbling into a temple to Demeter, where the floor was covered with piles of mixed grains.
She started sorting the grains into organized piles and, when she finished, Demeter spoke to her, telling her that the best way to find Eros was to find his mother, Aphrodite, and earn her blessing.
Psyche found a temple to Aphrodite and entered it.
Aphrodite assigned her a similar task to Demeter's temple, but gave her an impossible deadline to finish it by.
Eros intervened, for he still loved her, and caused some ants to organize the grains for her.
Aphrodite was outraged at her success and told her to go to a field where golden sheep grazed and get some golden wool.
Psyche went to the field and and saw the sheep but was stopped by a river-god, whose river she had to cross to enter the field.
He told her the sheep were mean and vicious and would kill her, but if she waited until noontime, the sheep would go the shade on the other side of the field and sleep; she could pick the wool that stuck to the branches and bark of the trees.
Psyche did so and Aphrodite was even more outraged at her survival and success.
Finally, Aphrodite claimed that the stress of caring for her son, depressed and ill as a result of Psyche's unfaithfulness, had caused her to lose some of her beauty.
Psyche was to go to Hades and ask Persephone, the queen of the underworld, for a bit of her beauty in a black box that Aphrodite gave to Psyche.
Psyche walked to a tower, deciding that the quickest way to the underworld would be to die.
A voice stopped her at the last moment and told her a route that would allow her to enter and return still living, as well as telling her how to pass Cerberus, Charon and the other dangers of the route.
She pacified Cerberus, the three-headed dog, with a sweet honey-cake and paid Charon an obolus to take her into Hades.
Once there, Persephone offered her a feast but Psyche refused, knowing it would keep her in the underworld forever.

Psyche left the underworld and decided to open the box and take a little bit of the beauty for herself.
Inside was a "Stygian sleep" which overtook her.
Eros, who had forgiven her, flew to her body and healed her, then begged Zeus and Aphrodite for their consent to his wedding of Psyche.
They agreed and Zeus made her immortal.</entry>

She was also called Kypris or Cytherea after her alleged birth-places in Cyprus and Cythera, respectively.
The island of Cythera was a center of her cult.
She was associated with Hesperia and frequently accompanied by the Oreads, nymphs of the mountains.

After this story became standard, Aphrodite was sometimes referred to as "Dione".
Alternatively, Aphrodite was a daughter of Thalassa and Zeus.
Due to her immense beauty, Zeus was frightened she would be the cause of violence between the other gods.
He married her off to Hephaestus, the dour, humorless god of smithing.
Hephaestus was overjoyed at being married to the goddess of beauty and forged her beautiful jewelry, including a girdle that made her even more irresistible to men.
Her unhappiness with her marriage caused Aphrodite to seek out companionship from others, most frequently Ares, but also Adonis, Anchises and more.

Aphrodite was Adonis' lover and had a part in his birth.
She urged Myrrha or Smyrna to commit incest with her father, Theias, the King of Assyria.
Myrrha's nurse helped with the scheme.
When Theias discovered this, he flew into a rage, chasing his daughter with a knife.
The gods turned her into a myrrh tree and Adonis eventually sprung from this tree.
Alternatively, Aphrodite turned her into a tree and Adonis was born when Theias shot the tree with an arrow or when a boar used its tusks to tear the tree's bark off.

Once Adonis was born, Aphrodite took him under her wing, seducing him with the help of Helene, her friend, and was entranced by his unearthly beauty.
She gave him to Persephone to watch over, but Persephone was also amazed at his beauty and refused to give him back.
The argument between the two goddess' was settled either by Zeus or Calliope, with Adonis spending four months with Aphrodite, four months with Persephone and four months of the years with whomever he chose.
He always chose Aphrodite because Persephone was the cold, unfeeling goddess of the underworld.

Adonis was eventually killed by a jealous Ares.
Pygmalion was a lonely sculptor who made a woman out of ivory and called her Galatea.
He prayed to Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty and love, who took pity on the lovesick artist, and brought to life the exquisite sculpture, which was named Galatea.
Pygmalion loved Galatea and they were soon married.
In one version of the story of Hippolytus, Aphrodite was the catalyst for his death.
He scorned the worship of Aphrodite for Artemis and, in revenge, Aphrodite caused his step-mother, Phaedra to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus would reject her.
In the most popular version of the story, Phaedra seeks revenge against Hippolytus by killing herself and, in her suicide note, telling Theseus, her husband and Hippolytus' father, that Hippolytus had raped her.
Theseus then murdered his own son before Artemis told him the truth.

King Glaucus of Corinth angered Aphrodite and she made her horses angry during the funeral games of King Pelias.
They tore him apart.
His ghost supposedly frightened horses during the Isthmian Games.

  <entry author_id="146755" end="206" start="110">Aphrodite (Αφροδίτη; No satisfactory etymology of the name has been given; although the first part is usually referred to αφρος ("the sea foam"), it is equally probable that it is of Eastern origin.
F. Homoll (Jahrbücher für classische Philologie, cxxv., 1882) explains it as a corruption of Ashtoreth; for other derivations see O. Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie, ii.
p. 1348, note 2.)
is the Greek goddess of love and beauty, counterpart of the Roman Venus.
Although her myth and cult were essentially Semitic, she soon became Hellenized and was admitted to a place among the deities of Olympus.
Some mythologists hold that there already existed in the Greek system an earlier goddess of love, of similar attributes, who was absorbed by the Asiatic importation; and one writer (A. Enmann) goes so far as to deny the oriental origin of Aphrodite altogether.
It is therefore necessary first to examine the nature and characteristics of her Eastern prototype, and then to see how far they reappear in the Greek Aphrodite.

Among the Semitic peoples (with the notable exception of the Hebrews) a supreme female deity was worshipped under different names--the Assyrian Ishtar, the Phoenician Ashtoreth (Astarte), the Syrian Atargatis (Derketo), the Babylonian Belit (Mylitta), the Arabian Ilat (Al-ilat).
The article "Aphrodite" in Roscher's Lexikon der Mythologie is based upon the theory that all these were originally moon-goddesses, on which assumption all their functions are explained.
This view, however, has not met with general acceptance, on the ground that, in Semitic mythology, the moon is always a male divinity; and that the full moon and crescent, found as attributes of Astarte, are due to a misinterpretation of the sun's disk and cow's horns of Isis, the result of the dependence of Syrian religious art upon Egypt.
On the other hand, there is some evidence in ancient authorities (Herodian v. 6, 10; Lucian, De Dea Syria, 4) that Astarte and the moon were considered identical.

This oriental Aphrodite was worshipped as the bestower of all animal and vegetable fruitfulness, and under this aspect especially as a goddess of women.
This worship was degraded by repulsive practices (e.g. religious prostitution, self-mutilation), which subsequently made their way to centres of Phoenician influence, such as Corinth and Mount Eryx in Sicily.
In this connexion may be mentioned the idea of a divinity, half male, half female, uniting in itself the active and passive functions of creation, a symbol of luxuriant growth and productivity.
Such was the bearded Aphrodite of Cyprus, called Aphrodites by Aristophanes according to Macrobius, who mentions a statue of the androgynous divinity in his Saturnalia (iii.
8.
2; see also Hermaphroditus).
The moon, by its connexion with menstruation, and as the cause of the fertilizing dew, was regarded as exercising an influence over the entire animal and vegetable creation.

The Eastern Aphrodite was closely related to the sea and the element of moisture; in fact, some consider that she made her first appearance on Greek soil rather as a marine divinity than as a nature goddess.
According to Syrian ideas, as a fish goddess, she represented the fructifying power of water.
At Ascalon there was a lake full of fish near the temple of Atargatis-Derketo, into which she was said to have been thrown together with her son Ichthys (fish) as a punishment for her arrogance, and to have been devoured by fishes; according to another version, ashamed of her amour with a beautiful youth, which resulted in the birth of Semiramis, she attempted to drown herself, but was changed into a fish with human face.
At Hierapolis (Bambyce) there was a pool with an altar in the middle, sacred to the goddess, where a festival was held, at which her images were carried into the water.
Her connexion with the sea is explained by the influence of the moon on the tides, and the idea that the moon, like the sun and the stars, came up from the ocean.

The oriental Aphrodite is connected with the lower world, and came to be looked upon as one of its divinities.
Thus, Ishtar descends to the kingdom of Ilat the queen of the dead, to find the means of restoring her favourite Tammuz (Adon, Adonis) to life.
During her stay all animal and vegetable productivity ceases, to begin again with her return to earth--a clear indication of the conception of her as a goddess of fertility.
This legend, which strikingly resembles that of Persephone, probably refers to the decay of vegetation in winter, and the reawakening of nature in spring (cf. Hyacinthus).
The lunar theory connects it with the disappearance of the moon at the time of change or during an eclipse.

The worship of Aphrodite at an early date was introduced into Cyprus, Cythera and Crete by Phoenician colonists, whence it spread over the whole of Greece, and as far west as Italy and Sicily.
In Crete she has been identified with Ariadne, who, according to one version of her story, was put ashore in Cyprus, where she died and was buried in a grove called after the name of Ariadne-Aphrodite (L. R. Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, ii.
p. 663).
Cyprus was regarded as her true home by the Greeks, and Cythera was one of the oldest seats of her worship (cf. her titles Cytherea, Cypris, Paphia, Amathusia, Idalia--the last three from places in Cyprus).
In both these islands there lingered a definite tradition of a connexion with the cult of the oriental Aphrodite Urania, an epithet which will be referred to later.
The oriental features of her worship as practised at Corinth are due to its early commercial relations with Asia Minor; the fame of her temple worship on Mount Eryx spread to Carthage, Rome and Latium.

In the Iliad, Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione, a name by which she herself is sometimes called.
This has been supposed to point to a confusion between Aphrodite and Hebe, the daughter of Zeus and Hera, Dione being an Epirot name for the last-named goddess.
In the Odyssey, she is the wife of Hephaestus, her place being taken in the Iliad by Charis, the personification of grace and divine skill, possibly supplanted by Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.
Her amour with Ares, by whom she became the mother of Harmonia, the wife of Cadmus, is famous (Od.
viii.
266).
From her relations with these acknowledged Hellenic divinites it is argued that there once existed a primitive Greek goddess of love.
This view is examined in detail and rejected by Farnell (Cults, ii.
pp.
619-626).

It is admitted that few traces remain of direct relations of the Greek goddess to the moon, although such possibly survive in the epithets πασιφαης, αστερια, ουρανια.
It is suggested that this is due to the fact that, at the time of the adoption of the oriental goddess, the Greeks already possessed lunar divinities in Hecate, Selene, Artemis.
But, although her connexion with the moon has practically disappeared, in all other aspects a development from the Semitic divinity is clearly manifest.

Aphrodite as the goddess of all fruitfulness in the animal and vegetable world is especially prominent.
In the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite she is described as ruling over all living things on earth, in the air, and in the water, even the gods being subject to her influence.
She is the goddess of gardens, especially worshipped in spring and near lowlands and marshes, favourable to the growth of vegetation.
As such in Crete she is called Antheia ("the flower-goddess"), at Athens εν κηποις ("in the gardens"), and εν καλαμοις ("in the reed-beds") or εν ελει ("in the marsh") at Samos.
Her character as a goddess of vegetation is clearly shown in the cult and ritual of Adonis (Farnell, ii.
p. 644) and Attis.
In the animal world she is the goddess of sexual impulse; amongst men, of birth, marriage, and family life.
To this aspect may be referred the names Genetyllis ("bringing about birth"), Arma (αρω, "to join," i.e., in marriage, cf. Harmonia), Nymphia ("bridal goddess"), Kourotrophos ("rearer of boys").
Aphrodite Apaturus (see G. M. Hirst in Journal of Hellenic Studies, xxiii., 1903) refers to her connexion with the clan and the festival Apaturia, at which children were admitted to the phratria.
It is pointed out by Farnell that this cult of Aphrodite, as the patroness of married life, is probably a native development of the Greek religion, the oriental legends representing her by no means as an upholder of the purer relations of man and woman.
As the goddess of the grosser form of love she inspires both men and women with passion (επιστροφια, "turning them to" thoughts of love), or the reverse (αποστροφια, "turning them away").
Upon her male favourites (Paris, Theseus) she bestows the fatal gift of seductive beauty, which generally leads to disastrous results in the case of the woman (Helen, Ariadne).
As μηχανιτις ("contriver") she acts as an intermediary for bringing lovers together, a similar idea being expressed in πραξις (of "success" in love, or = creatrix).
The two epithets ανδροφονος ("man-slayer") and σωσανδρα ("man-preserver") find an illustration in the pseudo-Plautine (in the Mercator) address to Astarte, who is described as the life and death, the saviour and destroyer of men and gods.
It was natural that a personality invested with such charms should be regarded as the ideal of womanly beauty, but it is remarkable that the only probable instance in which she appears as such is as Aphrodite μορφω ("form") at Sparta (O. Gruppe suggests the meaning "ghost," C. Tumpel the "dark one," referring to Aphrodite's connexion with the lower world).
The function of Aphrodite as the patroness of courtesans represents the most degraded form of her worship as the goddess of love, and is certainly of Phoenician or Eastern origin.
In Corinth there were more than a thousand of these ιεροδουλοι ("temple slaves"), and wealthy men made it a point of honour to dedicate their most beautiful slaves to the service of the goddess.

Like her oriental prototype, the Greek Aphrodite was closely connected with the sea.
Thus, in the Hesiodic account of her birth, she is represented as sprung from the foam which gathered round the mutilated member of Uranus, and her name has been explained by reference to this.
Further proof may be found in many of her titles--αναδυομενη ("rising from the sea"), ευπλοια ("giver of prosperous voyages"), γαληναια ("goddess of fair weather"), κατασκοπια ("she who keeps a look-out from the heights")--in the attribute of the dolphin, and the veneration in which she was held by seafarers.
Aphrodite Aineias, the protectress of the Trojan hero, is probably also another form of the maritime goddess of the East (see E. Worner, article "Aineias" in Roscher's Lexikon, and Farnell, ii.
p. 638), which originated in the Troad, where Aphrodite Aineias may have been identical with the earth-goddess Cybele.
The title εφιππος is connected with the legend of Aeneas, who is said to have dedicated to his mother a statue that represented her on horseback.
Remembering the importance of the horse in the cult of the sea-god Poseidon, it is natural to associate it with Aphrodite as the sea-goddess, although it may be explained with reference to her character as a goddess of vegetation, the horse being an embodiment of the corn-spirit (see J. G. Frazer, The Golden Bough, ii., 1900, p. 281).

The cult of the armed Aphrodite probably belongs to the earlier period of her worship in Greece, and down to the latest period of Greek history she retained this character in some of the Greek states.
The cult is found not only where oriental influence was strongest, but in places remote from it, such as Sparta, where she was known by the name of Areia ("the warlike"), and there are numerous references in the Anthology to an Aphrodite armed with helmet and spear.
It is possible that the frequent association of Aphrodite with Ares is to be explained by an armed Aphrodite early worshipped at Thebes, the most ancient seat of the worship of Ares.

The most distinctively oriental title of the Greek Aphrodite is Urania, the Semitic "queen of the heavens."
It has been explained by reference to the lunar character of the goddess, but more probably signifies "she whose seat is in heaven," whence she exercises her sway over the whole world--earth, sea, and air alike.
Her cult was first established in Cythera, probably in connexion with the purple trade, and at Athens it is associated with the legendary Porphyrion, the purple king.
At Thebes, Harmonia (who has been identified with Aphrodite herself) dedicated three statues, of Aphrodite Urania, Pandemos, and Apostrophia.
A few words must be added on the second of these titles.
There is no doubt that Pandemos was originally an extension of the idea of the goddess of family and city life to include the whole people, the political community.
Hence the name was supposed to go back to the time of Theseus, the reputed author of the reorganization of Attica and its demes.
Aphrodite Pandemos was held in equal regard with Urania; she was called σεμνη ("holy"), and was served by priestesses upon whom strict chastity was enjoined.
In time, however, the meaning of the term underwent a change, probably due to the philosophers and moralists, by whom a radical distinction was drawn betwee Aphrodite Urania and Pandemos.
According to Plato (Symposium, 180), there are two Aphrodites, "the elder, having no mother, who is called the heavenly Aphrodite--she is the daughter of Uranus; the younger, who is the daughter of Zeus and Dione--her we call common."
The same distinction is found in Xenophon's Symposium (viii.
9), although the author is doubtful whether there are two goddesses, or whether Urania and Pandemos are two names for the same goddess, just as Zeus, although one and the same, has many titles; but in any case, he says, the ritual of Urania is purer, more serious, than that of Pandemos.
The same idea is expressed in the statement (quoted by Athenaeus, 569d, from Nicander of Colophon) that after Solon's time courtesans were put under the protection of Aphrodite Pandemos.
But there is no doubt that the cult of Aphrodite was on the whole as pure as that of any other divinities, and although a distinction may have existed in later times between the goddess of legal marriage and the goddess of free love, these titles do not express the idea.
Aphrodite Urania was represented in Greek art on a swan, a tortoise or a globe; Aphrodite Pandemos as riding on a goat, symbolical of wantonness.
(For the legend of Theseus and Aphrodite hepitagia, "on the goat," see Farnell, Cults, ii.
p.
633.)

In ancient art Aphrodite was at first represented clothed, sometimes seated, but more frequently standing; then naked, rising from the sea, or after the bath.
Finally, all idea of the divine vanished, and the artists merely presented her as the type of a beautiful woman, with oval face, full of grace and charm, languishing eyes, and laughing mouth, which replaced the dignified severity and repose of the older forms.
The most famous of her statues in ancient times was that at Cnidus, the work of Praxiteles, which was imitated on the coins of that town, and subsequently reproduced in various copies, such as the Vatican and Munich.
Of existing statues the most famous is the Aphrodite of Melos (Venus of Milo), now in the Louvre, which was found on the island in 1820 amongst the ruins of the theatre; the Capitoline Venus at Rome and the Venus of Capua, represented as a goddess of victory (these two exhibit a lofty conception of the goddess); the Medicean Venus at Florence, found in the porticus of Octavia at Rome and (probably wrongly) attributed to Cleomenes; the Venus stooping in the bath, in the Vatican; and the Callipygos at Naples, a specimen of the most sensual type.</entry>
  <entry author_id="2410920" end="218" start="206">The etymology of the name of the ancient Pelasgian goddess Aphrodite: In Albanian, which is direct successor to Illyrian and Pelasgian languages, there is the word "afër" (adv.
near), "afron" (v. coming near, approaching), "afro" (v. come near, close).
In Albanian, there is also the word "Ditë" (ë - indefinite article), "Dita" (a - definite article), which means "Day".
Hence "Afër", "Afron" or "Afro" + "Ditë" or "Dita" = "Afërditë", "Afërdita" - "Afronditë", "Afrondita" - or "Afroditë", "Afrodita", which is the morning star that shows in the sky before dawn.
In this word formation, "afër", "afron" and "afro" are used as adjectives to the word "Ditë", "Dita".
Albanians call the morning star the star of Afërditë or Afroditë.
"Afroditë" means approaching day or daylight in the Albanian language.
C. Kerenyi says that in the heavens the star of morning - the planet Venus - belonged to this goddess.
According to the Albanian historian from Greece Aristidh Kola, Etruscans called her "Apru", which is similar to the Albanian word "Afro".
The name of the month of April is more likely to have derived from "Apru" and not from Turan.
The same historian holds that Turan, the Etruscan equivalent of our goddess, means 'very high'.
Its root is Tur = tower.Her Roman analogue is Venus.</entry>
  <entry author_id="5289658" end="229" start="218">She called upon her children, the twelve Titans, and asked who it was who had the courage to take vengeance on their father in her name.
The youngest, Cronus, spoke out in favour of the deed, and Gaea soon formed a scythe out of flawless adamant, which Cronus took and vanquished his father by castrating him.
He then took his father's freshly severed genitals and threw them down to earth, his mother.
From these genitals flowed Uranus' semen, which landed onto land and sea.
From the fertilised ovums of the soil, Gaea bore the three Erinnyes, snake-haired, bitch-faced flying hags who tormented the souls of evil-doers.

From the fertilised ovums found in the foam of the sea (in Greek called aphros, hence the love goddess' name), formed a completely different being!
From the very depths of the oceans arose a giant sea shell, and from it came Aphrodite, the daughter of Gaea's foam.
She was well formed, a face outshining the sun's own beauty, skin as soft as a flower's petal and pink-tinted with well-formed breasts and rounded hips.
Her golden hair curled from her head down to her toes, and her eyes the very colour of the sea which bore her.
The Seasons then came and dressed her in the finest linen, and took her to Mount Olympus, becoming the goddess of Love and Beauty.
