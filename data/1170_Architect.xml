  <entry author_id="72724" end="53" start="0">In the United States, people wishing to become licensed architects are required to meet the requirements of their respective state.
Each state has a registration board to oversee that state's licensure laws.
In 1919, the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) was created to ensure parity between the states' often conflicting rules.
The registration boards of each of the 50 states (and 5 territories), are NCARB member boards.

While registration requirements do vary between jurisdictions, there are three common requirements for registration: education, experience and examination.
Most states require a professional degree from a school accredited by the NAAB to satisfy their education requirement; this would be either a B.Arch or M.Arch degree.
The experience requirement is typically the Intern Development Program (IDP), a joint program of NCARB and the AIA.
IDP creates a framework to identify for the intern-architect base skills and core-competencies.
The intern-architect needs to earn 700 training units (TUs) in 16 categories; each TU is equivalent to 8 hours.
California is the lone exception requiring C-IDP which builds upon the seat time requirement of IDP with the need to document learning having occurred.
All jurisdictions use the Architect Registration Examination (ARE), a series of nine computerized exams administered NCARB.

NCARB also has a certification for those architects meeting NCARB's model standard: NAAB degree, IDP and ARE passage.
This certificate facilitates reciprocity between the member boards should an architect desire registration in a different jurisdiction.
All architects licensed by their respective states have professional status as Registered Architects (RA).

There are three types of professional degrees in architecture in the United States: the Bachelor of Architecture, Master of Architecture, and the Doctorate degrees - either Doctor of Architecture, Doctor of Design or Doctor of Philosophy, respectively abbreviated as "B.Arch," "M.Arch," and "D.Arch.
", "D.Des."
or "Ph.D." Non-professional degrees include the Bachelor of Arts in Architecture (BA), Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BS), Bachelor of Fine Arts in Architecture (BFA Arch), and "Bachelor of Environmental Design" (B.Envd).
A non-professional degree typically takes four years to complete (as opposed to five years for a Bachelor of Architecture) and may be part of the later completion of professional degree (A "4+2" plan is comprised of a 4-year BA and a 2-year Master of Architecture).
The 5-year BArch and 6-year MArch are regarded as virtual equals in the registration and accreditation processes.
Other programs (such as those offered at Drexel University and Boston Architectural College) combine the required educational courses with the work component necessary to sit for licensure exams.
Programs such as this often afford students the ability to immediately test for licensure upon graduation, as opposed to having to put in several years working in the field after graduation before being able to get licensed, as is common in more traditional programs.

The Society of American Registered Architects or SARA is another professional organization for registered architects in the United States.
Its activities and services include conventions, continuing education programs, standard contracts and other practice-related documents, and design award programs.
Members of this organization may have the suffix "SARA" after their name.

The National Organization of Minority Architects or NOMA is an organization for minority registered architects and minority architectural students in the United States.
It was created in 1971 to bring light to the contributions of African Americans and other minorities in the field of architecture in the United States and the world.
Per the 2006-2007 Occupation Outlook Handbook published by the US Department of Labor, the median salary of architects was $62,960 with the middle 50% earning between $46,690 and $79,230.
This was slightly above accountants (median income $50,770), college professors (median income $51,800) and on par with most branches of engineering (median income of roughly $60K).
Senior architects and partners in mid to large size firms in many urban areas typically have earnings that exceed $100K annually.
Principals in larger national firms may have incomes two or three times that figure or more, comparable to many executive management positions.

Many architects elect to move into real estate development, corporate planning, project management and other specialized roles which can earn significantly higher income than the industry median.
In the UK the title "architect" is protected by law, and only those who have the recognised qualifications ratified by the Architects Registration Board in conjunction with the Royal Institute of British Architects are allowed to call themselves architects.
In the UK it takes a minimum of seven years to train to be an architect.
Those wishing to become architects must first study at a recognised university-level school of architecture.
Though there are some variations from university to university, the basic principle is that in order to qualify as an architect one must pass through three stages: 1.
On completing a three year B.A, B.Arch or B.Sc degree in architecture the candidate receives exemption from RIBA Part I.
There then follows a period of a minimum of one year which the candidate spends in an architect's office gaining work experience.
2.
The candidate must then complete a post-graduate university course, usually two years, to receive either a Diploma (Dip.Arch) or Masters (M.Arch).
On completing that course, the candidate receives exemption from Part II of the RIBA process.
3.
The candidate must then spend a further period of at least one year before being allowed to take the RIBA Part III examination in Professional Practice and Management.
In Australia the title of architect is legally protected and architects are registered through state boards.
These boards are affiliated through the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia.
The AACA also provides accreditation for schools and assessments for architects with overseas qualifications for the purposes of migration.
There are three key requirements for registration: a professional degree from a school of architecture accredited by the AACA; at least two years of practical experience, and; the completion of the architectural practice examination.
Architects may also belong to the Royal Australian Institute of Architects which is the professional organisation and members use the suffix RAIA after their name.
In Canada, architects are required to belong to provincial architectural associations that require them to complete an accredited degree in architecture, finish a multi-year internship process, pass a series of exams, and pay an annual fee to acquire and maintain a license to practice.
The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada is a national body that aims to be "the voice of Architecture and its practice in Canada".
Members are permitted to use the suffix MRAIC after their names.
All members of the RAIC hold accredited degrees in architecture, but not all Canadian architects are members of the RAIC.
Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the 20th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting but usually carried the title of "master builder" or "surveyor", after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir Christopher Wren).
The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.</entry>
  <entry author_id="2998723" end="174" start="53">About 1 in 4 architects was self-employed—more than three times the proportion for all professional and related occupations.
Licensing requirements include a professional degree in architecture, 3 years of practical work training, and passing all divisions of the Architect Registration Examination.
Architecture graduates may face competition, especially for jobs in the most prestigious firms; opportunities will be best for those with experience working for a firm while still in school and for those with knowledge of computer-aided design and drafting technology.
Nature of the Work this section Back to Top

People need places in which to live, work, play, learn, worship, meet, govern, shop, and eat.
These places may be private or public; indoors or outdoors; or rooms, buildings, or complexes, and together, they make up neighborhoods, towns, suburbs, and cities.
Architects—licensed professionals trained in the art and science of building design—transform these needs into concepts and then develop the concepts into images and plans of buildings that can be constructed by others.

Architects design the overall aesthetic and look of buildings and other structures, but the design of a building involves far more than its appearance.
Buildings also must be functional, safe, and economical and must suit the needs of the people who use them.
Architects consider all these factors when they design buildings and other structures.

Architects provide professional services to individuals and organizations planning a construction project.
They may be involved in all phases of development, from the initial discussion with the client through the entire construction process.
Their duties require specific skills—designing, engineering, managing, supervising, and communicating with clients and builders.
Architects spend a great deal of time explaining their ideas to clients, construction contractors, and others.
Successful architects must be able to communicate their unique vision persuasively.

The architect and client discuss the objectives, requirements, and budget of a project.
In some cases, architects provide various predesign services—conducting feasibility and environmental impact studies, selecting a site, or specifying the requirements the design must meet.
For example, they may determine space requirements by researching the numbers and types of potential users of a building.
The architect then prepares drawings and a report presenting ideas for the client to review.

After discussing and agreeing on the initial proposal, architects develop final construction plans that show the building’s appearance and details for its construction.
Accompanying these plans are drawings of the structural system; air-conditioning, heating, and ventilating systems; electrical systems; communications systems; plumbing; and, possibly, site and landscape plans.
The plans also specify the building materials and, in some cases, the interior furnishings.
In developing designs, architects follow building codes, zoning laws, fire regulations, and other ordinances, such as those requiring easy access by disabled persons.
Throughout the planning stage, they make necessary changes.
Computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) technology has replaced traditional paper and pencil as the most common method for creating design and construction drawings.
Continual revision of plans on the basis of client needs and budget constraints is often necessary.

Architects may also assist clients in obtaining construction bids, selecting contractors, and negotiating construction contracts.
As construction proceeds, they may visit building sites to make sure that contractors follow the design, adhere to the schedule, use the specified materials, and meet work quality standards.
The job is not complete until all construction is finished, required tests are conducted, and construction costs are paid.
Sometimes, architects also provide postconstruction services, such as facilities management.
They advise on energy efficiency measures, evaluate how well the building design adapts to the needs of occupants, and make necessary improvements.

Architects design a wide variety of buildings, such as office and apartment buildings, schools, churches, factories, hospitals, houses, and airport terminals.
They also design complexes such as urban centers, college campuses, industrial parks, and entire communities.
In addition, they may advise on the selection of building sites, prepare cost analysis and land-use studies, and do long-range planning for land development.

Architects sometimes specialize in one phase of work.
Some specialize in the design of one type of building—for example, hospitals, schools, or housing.
Others focus on planning and predesign services or construction management and do minimal design work.
They often work with engineers, urban planners, interior designers, landscape architects, and other professionals.
In fact, architects spend a great deal of their time coordinating information from, and the work of, others engaged in the same project.
Many architects—particularly at larger firms—use the Internet and e-mail to update designs and communicate changes efficiently.
Architects also use the Internet to research product specifications and government regulations.

Architects usually work in a comfortable environment.
Most of their time is spent in offices consulting with clients, developing reports and drawings, and working with other architects and engineers.
However, they often visit construction sites to review the progress of projects.
Although most architects work approximately 40 hours per week, they often have to work nights and weekends to meet deadlines.

All States and the District of Columbia require individuals to be licensed (registered) before they may call themselves architects and contract to provide architectural services.
During this time between graduation and becoming licensed, architecture school graduates generally work in the field under supervision of a licensed architect who takes legal responsibility for all work.
Licensing requirements include a professional degree in architecture, a period of practical training or internship, and a passing score on all divisions of the Architect Registration Examination (ARE).

In most States, the professional degree in architecture must be from one of the 113 schools of architecture that have degree programs accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).
However, State architectural registration boards set their own standards, so graduation from a non-NAAB-accredited program may meet the educational requirement for licensing in a few States.
Three types of professional degrees in architecture are available through colleges and universities.
The majority of all architectural degrees are from 5-year Bachelor of Architecture programs, intended for students entering university-level studies from high school or with no previous architectural training.
In addition, a number of schools offer a 2-year Master of Architecture program for students with a preprofessional undergraduate degree in architecture or a related area, or a 3- or 4-year Master of Architecture program for students with a degree in another discipline.

The choice of degree depends upon each individual’s preference and educational background.
Prospective architecture students should consider the available options before committing to a program.
For example, although the 5-year Bachelor of Architecture program offers the fastest route to the professional degree, courses are specialized, and if the student does not complete the program, transferring to a program offered by another discipline may be difficult.
A typical program includes courses in architectural history and theory, building design, structures, technology, construction methods, professional practice, math, physical sciences, and liberal arts.
Central to most architectural programs is the design studio, where students put into practice the skills and concepts learned in the classroom.
During the final semester of many programs, students devote their studio time to creating an architectural project from beginning to end, culminating in a three-dimensional model of their design.

Architects must be able to communicate their ideas visually to their clients.
Artistic and drawing ability is helpful, but not essential, to such communication.
More important are a visual orientation and the ability to conceptualize and understand spatial relationships.
Good communication skills, the ability to work independently or as part of a team, and creativity are important qualities for anyone interested in becoming an architect.
Computer literacy also is required for writing specifications, for two- and three-dimensional drafting, and for financial management.
Knowledge of CADD is essential and has become a critical tool for architects.
Most schools now teach students CADD programs and methods that adhere to the National CAD Standards.

All State architectural registration boards require architecture graduates to complete a training period—usually 3 years—before they may sit for the ARE, the third and final requirement for becoming licensed.
Every State, with the exception of Arizona, has adopted the training standards established by the Intern Development Program, a branch of the American Institute of Architects and the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB).
These standards stipulate broad and diversified training under the supervision of a licensed architect over a 3-year period.
Most new graduates complete their training period by working as interns at architectural firms.
Some States allow a portion of the training to occur in the offices of related professionals, such as engineers or general contractors.
Architecture students who complete internships in architectural firms while still in school can count some of that time toward the required 3-year training period.

After completing their on-the-job training period, interns are eligible to sit for the ARE.
The examination tests a candidate’s knowledge, skills, and ability to provide the various services required in the design and construction of buildings.
The test is broken down into 9 divisions consisting of either multiple choice or graphical questions; States give candidates an eligibility period for completion of all divisions of the exam that varies by State.
Candidates who pass the ARE and meet all standards established by their State Board become licensed to practice in that State.

A growing number of architects voluntarily seek certification by the NCARB, which can facilitate an individual’s becoming licensed to practice in additional States.
This practice is known as “reciprocity.” Certification is awarded after independent verification of the candidate’s educational transcripts, employment record, and professional references.
Certification is the primary requirement for reciprocity of licensing among State Boards that are NCARB members.
In 2004, approximately one-third of all licensed architects had NCARB certification.

After becoming licensed and gaining experience, architects take on increasingly responsible duties, eventually managing entire projects.
In large firms, architects may advance to supervisory or managerial positions.
Some architects become partners in established firms, while others set up their own practices.
Graduates with degrees in architecture also enter related fields, such as graphic, interior, or industrial design; urban planning; real estate development; civil engineering; and construction management.

Architects held about 129,000 jobs in 2004.
Approximately 3 out of 5 jobs were in the architectural, engineering, and related services industry—mostly in architectural firms with fewer than five workers.
A small number worked for residential and nonresidential building construction firms and for government agencies responsible for housing, community planning, or construction of government buildings, such as the U.S.
Departments of Defense and Interior, and the General Services Administration.
About 1 in 4 architects was self-employed.

Employment of architects is expected to grow about as fast the average for all occupations through 2014.
Besides employment growth, additional job openings will arise from the need to replace the many architects who are nearing retirement, and others who transfer to other occupations or stop working for other reasons.
Internship opportunities for new architectural students are expected to be good over the next decade, but more students are graduating with architectural degrees and some competition for entry-level jobs can be anticipated.
Competition will be especially keen for jobs at the most prestigious architectural firms as prospective architects try to build their reputation.
Prospective architects who have had internships while in school will have an advantage in obtaining intern positions after graduation.

Employment of architects is strongly tied to the activity of the construction industry.
Strong growth is expected to come from nonresidential construction as demand for commercial space increases.
Residential construction, buoyed by low interest rates, is also expected to grow as more and more people become homeowners.
If interest rates rise significantly, this sector may see a falloff in home building.

Current demographic trends also support an increase in demand for architects.
As the population of Sunbelt States continues to grow, the people living there will need new places to live and work.
As the population continues to live longer and baby-boomers begin to retire there will be a need for more healthcare facilities, nursing homes, and retirement communities.
In education, buildings at all levels are getting older and class sizes are getting larger.
This will require many school districts and universities to build new facilities and renovate existing ones.

Some types of construction are sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy.
Architects seeking design projects for office and retail construction will face especially strong competition for jobs or clients during recessions, and layoffs may ensue in less successful firms.
Those involved in the design of institutional buildings, such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and correctional facilities, will be less affected by fluctuations in the economy.
Residential construction makes up a small portion of work for architects, so major changes in the housing market would not be as significant as fluctuations in the nonresidential market.

Despite good overall job opportunities some architects may not fare as well as others.
The profession is geographically sensitive and some parts of the Nation may have fewer new building projects than others.
Also, many firms specialize in specific buildings, such as hospitals or office towers, and demand for these buildings may vary by region.
Architects may find it increasingly necessary to gain reciprocity in order to compete for the best jobs and projects in other States.

In recent years, some architecture firms have outsourced to architecture firms overseas the drafting of construction documents for large-scale commercial and residential projects.
This trend is expected to continue and may have a negative impact on employment growth for lower level architects and interns who would normally gain experience by producing these drawings.
However, most firms will keep design services in-house, and opportunities will be best for those architects that are able to distinguish themselves from others with their creativity.

Median annual earnings of wage and salary architects were $60,300 in May 2004.
The middle 50 percent earned between $46,690 and $79,230.
The lowest 10 percent earned less than $38,060, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $99,800.
Those just starting their internships can expect to earn considerably less.

Architects design buildings and related structures.
Construction managers, like architects, also plan and coordinate activities concerned with the construction and maintenance of buildings and facilities.
Others who engage in similar work are landscape architects, civil engineers, urban and regional planners, and designers, including interior designers, commercial and industrial designers, and graphic designers.</entry>

  <entry author_id="3892070" end="314" start="295">Although the term "architect" refers to a professionally-qualified individual, the word is frequently used in the broader sense noted above to define someone who brings order to a built or non-built situation.
In practice, an architect accepts a commission from a client (an individual, a board of directors, a government agency or a corporation).
This commission may involve the preparation of feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a single building, or the design of several buildings, structures and the spaces between them.
Increasingly, the architect participates in the development of requirements the client wishes to have met in the building.
Throughout the project, from planning to occupancy, the architect usually acts as the coordinator of a team of specialists.
Structural, mechanical, and electrical engineers, and other specialists, are generally retained by the building owner or the architect.
The architect must ensure that the work of all these different disciplines is coordinated and fits together in the overall design.

Architects must also deal with various government agencies on various local and federal levels, regarding numerous codes and by-laws.
In addition, close attention must be paid to the economics and budget for a particular commission.
In contemporary times, there are many factors which dictate the eventual design of a building and the architect incorporates the input of many specialists and the client.
The practice of architecture is a business, in which technical knowledge, management skills, and an understanding of good business practice are as important as creative design.

Earnings for architects range widely, depending on experience, and where and how they work.
Salaries also vary depending on the size and location of the practice.
Earnings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms.

According to the 2006–2007 Occupation Outlook Handbook published by the US Department of Labor, the median salary of architects was $62,960 with the middle 50% earning between $46,690 and $79,230.
The Royal Society of Architects in Wales (RSAW) publishes a rough guide to the kind of salaries you can expect at the various stages of qualification: Beginning level candidates (part one) can expect between £15,000 and £18,500.
Recent graduates (part two) earn between £22,000 - £29,000.
Newly registered architects (part three) earn £29,000 - £32,000; part three, three to five years post-registration £34,000 - £40,000 (salary data collected May 06).
The range of typical salaries at senior levels (after 10-15 years in role)is between £32,000 to £80,000, depending on the seniority of the position.</entry>

Architects must also understand the various methods available to the builder for building the client's structure, so that he or she can negotiate with the client to produce a best possible compromise of the results desired within explicit cost and time boundaries.
The idea of what constitutes a result desired varies among architects, as the values and attitudes which underlie modern architecture differ both between the schools of thought which influence architecture and between individual practising architects.

The practice of architecture is a business, in which technical knowledge, management skills, and an understanding of good business practice are as important as creative design.
In practice, an architect accepts a commission from a client (an individual, a board of directors, a government agency or a corporation).

An architect accepts a commission from a client.
The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them.
The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building.
Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team.
Structural, mechanical, and electrical engineers and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.

An architect must understand building and operational codes, the construction methods available to the builder in constructing a client's building and structures, and the desired results with the actual costs and construction schedule limits.
Work time is usually a standard work week, but when working towards a deadline the architect often works long hours.
Architects are office-based professionals, but the work usually includes visiting clients and regular visits to job sites.
Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and building codes.
The architect might need to comply with local planning and zoning laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and land use.
Some established jurisdictions, require adherence to design and historic preservation guidelines.

Architects prepare the technical documents (construction drawings and specifications) filed for obtaining permits (development and building permits) that require compliance with building, seismic, and relevant federal and local regulations.
Said construction drawings and specifications are used for pricing the work and in the construction.
Architects typically put projects to tender on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a general contractor, and review the progress of the work during construction.
They typically review subcontractor shop drawings, prepare and issue site instructions, and provide construction contract administration (see also Design-bid-build).
In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the work is required.

Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less inclusive (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable design-build functions).
With very large, complex projects, an independent construction manager is sometimes hired to assist in design and to manage construction.
In the United Kingdom and other countries, a quantity surveyor is often part of the team to provide cost consulting.
Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession.
Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example health care, retail, public housing, etc.), technological expertise or project delivery methods.
Some architects specialize as building code, building envelope, sustainable design, historic preservation, accessibility and other forms of specialist consultants.</entry>
  <entry author_id="1556153" end="395" start="383">With the advent of the computer and its ability to communicate via e-mail, it has become customary to be in the office often.
However, the profession did have a history of being  a lot more field oriented before the implementation of the design bid build system.
Whats more, there are at least two kinds of offices in practice, the design office and the commercial office.
A design office is a more refined and usually higher quality product because the amount of work made to craft a building including using models to work the three dimensional aspects of the building.
Commercial offices focus almost exclusively on the technical aspect of the building and work a lot faster, Most of their work is done exclusively in two dimensions(plans, elevations, sections).
Commercial firms will sometimes do a model at the end when they have a final design if the client is willing to pay for it.
Everything in commercial offices is faster paced.
Some offices might work in between the two types, but the design office and the commercial office are the two opposites.
There are far more commercial offices than design offices.
The quality and design style emphasis of the design offices vary from office to office.
Examples of design offices include Morphosis and the Jean Nouvel Atalier.
Commercial offices might be HOK, KPF, SOM.</entry>

The experience requirement for degreed candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction).
Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting.
Instead, they often trained under established architects.
Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, engineers and often artists, and the title used varied depending on geographical location.
They often carried the title of master builder, or surveyor, after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir Christopher Wren).
The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.
Main article: Professional requirements for architects Although there are variations from place to place, in most of the world architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction.
To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.
Educational requirements generally consist of completion of High School General Education along with a transcript that proves the individual earned at least a C- average grade in Mathematics, Physics, English, Art and Chemistry.
The experience requirement for degreed candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction).
Finally, a Registration Examination is required in order to obtain your license.
The thirty-minute exam is composed of three essential parts.
First, the blueprint design of the structure must be sketched out.
Then with a set of five hundred legos, the design must be turned in from a two dimensional picture to a three-dimensional structure.
Finally, the structure must undergo a series of natural disaster recovery examinations.
It must withstand two minutes under a shower that propels water under pressure.
Then it will have to resist the high winds of twenty blow driers to test the validity of the structures endurance for high wind pressure.
The final exam that the structure model must pass is the despicable thirty-second-hurricane simulation in a washing machine, in which powerful forces will determine the strength and durability of the structures foundation and design.

In that, the architect must meet with and question the client to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project.
This information, known as a program or brief, is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs and desires of the owner—it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.

Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and building codes.
The architect might need to comply with local planning and zoning laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and land use.
Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and historic preservation guidelines.
Architects prepare the technical or "working" documents (construction drawings and specifications), usually coordinated with and supplemented by the work of a variety of disciplines with varied expertise like mechanical, plumbing, electrical, civil, structural, etc. engineers for the building services and that are filed for obtaining permits (development and building permits) that require compliance with building, seismic, and relevant federal and local regulations.
These construction drawings and specifications are also used for pricing the work, and for construction.
Architects typically put projects to tender on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a general contractor, and review the progress of the work during construction.
They typically review subcontractor shop drawings and other submittals, prepare and issue site instructions, and provide construction contract administration and Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also Design-bid-build).
In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the work is required.
