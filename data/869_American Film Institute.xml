  <entry author_id="10217132" end="27" start="0">American Film Institute The American Film Institute (AFI.com) was founded in 1967 as a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of America’s film heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers and honor the artists and their work.
The National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities recommended creating AFI “to enrich and nurture the art of film in America” with initial funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Motion Picture Association of America and the Ford Foundation.
The original 22-member Board of Trustees included Chair Gregory Peck and Vice Chair Sidney Poitier as well as Francis Ford Coppola, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Jack Valenti and other representatives from the arts and academia.

George Stevens, Jr., was the founding director.
Jean Picker Firstenberg was President and CEO from 1980 to 2007.
Bob Gazzale was named President and CEO in 2007.
As a national nonprofit organization, the institute funds its efforts through contributions and sponsorships from large corporations and small companies, donations from individuals and its AFI membership program, with entry level starting at $50 a year.

In 1969, the institute established the Center for Advanced Film Studies at Greystone, the Doheny Mansion in Beverly Hills, CA.
The first class included filmmakers Terrence Malick, David Lynch, Caleb Deschanel and Paul Schrader.
That program grew into the AFI Conservatory, a fully accredited graduate film school, located in the hills above Hollywood, CA.
In addition to the Conservatory, AFI has a tuition-free program called the AFI Directing Workshop for Women that operates each spring and summer from the LA campus.
The AFI Catalog of Feature Films, started in 1968, is an online database that preserves the history of American film in authoritative, encyclopedic detail.
A prime research tool for film historians, the catalog consists of entries on more than 50,000 films, from 1893 to the mid-1970s, documenting casts, crews, synopses and production notes.
New catalog entries of the remaining 15,000 American feature films produced between 1974 and present day are incorporated every year.

The annual AFI AWARDS honors the creative ensembles of the 10 outstanding movies and television shows of the year.
Two 13-person juries composed of artists, academics, critics and AFI Trustees deliberate, discuss and determine the honored ensembles, who are then feted at a private event in January.
In addition, Ten Moments of Significance, documenting the year’s media milestones, are entered into an ongoing almanac.

The popular AFI 100 Years… television series, which ran from 1998 to 2008, and created jury-selected lists of America’s best movies in categories including Musicals, Laughs and Thrills, drove new generations to experience classic American films.
The juries consisted of over 1,500 artists, scholars, critics and historians, with movies selected based on the film’s popularity over time, historical significance and cultural impact.
CITIZEN KANE was voted the greatest American film.

As the largest nonprofit exhibitor in the United States, AFI screens films regularly at the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, MD, and the ArcLight Cinemas and Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, CA.
Programming at the AFI Silver Theatre consists of an eclectic mix of retrospectives, festivals and first-run features as well as community events and educational activities.
In addition, AFI operates two film festivals: AFI FEST presented by Audi in Los Angeles, CA, and AFI–Discovery Channel SILVERDOCS documentary festival in Silver Spring, MD.
AFI FEST is the only film festival in the US to hold FIAPF (Fédération Internationale des Associations de Producteurs de Films) accreditation.

AFI PROJECT: 20/20 is a global exchange program that promotes cultural understanding through film.
The program sends filmmakers to festivals and cultural institutions around the world to screen their films and engage audiences in discussions that challenge stereotypes and encourage mutual respect.
The program is a collaboration between AFI and America’s four government cultural agencies—the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities.</entry>
